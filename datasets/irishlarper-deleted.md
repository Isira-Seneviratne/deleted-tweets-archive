In the 80s and 90s there was a huge push to ban "junk handguns," basically small caliber pistols. When this succeeded to a degree, the NRA/NSSF realized they could fill it with CCW

While it was a thing beforehand, it exploded afterwards. If you got back to 1989 and the foreign rifle import ban, the NRA put up only the most mild of objections, calling for a "rational discussion" on the issue.

I consider myself knowledgeable yet I got fucked pretty hard on a purchase I made a few weeks ago.

Not saying they're better people - just a different breed.  The most common profession I've encountered for gun dealers is mechanic.   Many with drug problems.

I'm not opposed to making money but when you have a political and economic shitstorm it's hard to have an honest business. I think a good start would be dropping a lot of barriers to the free trade of arms. Reduces the need for shitbaggery

I don't know how you'd have some utopian arms trade when there's a lot of money to be made in very niche collector's markets.   A lot of older people with a lot of money willing to spend hundreds of dollars on a safety for their M1 carbine just invites fraud

The controls will be a bit weird at first (though I think they offer alternate more modern styles on the Xbox one and PS4 editions) but you get the hang of it.

I strongly recommend going to a 9mm handgun and a 5.56 rifle. Plenty of ammunition available and can do whatever you need them to do

I think a lot of the impulse on a .45 is negated by the heavy slide and gun itself. If you shoot .45 unsuppressed on say a USP, you notice a lot more movement on that gun as the weight

The English gun is probably the nicest of the bunch as the two California guns don't work right now. Never had a Japanese one. Might get rid of my Costa Mesa rifles for a Japanese made one

It has some design deficiencies namely a stock hinge that doesn't hold up to abuse (normal use is fine). Also the handguards are hand fitted and will eventually become loose.

Resident Evil 3 PSX is excellent and well. 4 is good but not really RE. 5 meh 6 horrible. CV probably underrated but never was a huge fan. 7 is a return to form.

No matter how many stories of elderly people being killed, children being raped and other pets being murdered, morons will still say they're wonderful.

Nearly all are "sweet, wonderful dogs" that are seeking new homes because they are attacking other dogs in the house. This isn't by chance. Example pic.twitter.com/Good3Psh6Z

Your dog on its back in a photo doesn't disprove the statistical fact.
* [13 May 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20191031070745/https://twitter.com/irishlarper/status/995567548019150848): Spend a day in Baltimore. Again, not a coincidence that these dogs are popular with unsavory elements of society. They don't select golden retrievers for fighting because if you put a cat in front of one, its instincts don't kick in that tell it to eat it.

My brother's ex-wife was attacked by one and lost some feeling in her arm from nerve damage. My ex girlfriend was nearly the victim of an attack but she managed to make it to her car before the dog got her. I know people whose cats were killed

They identify with these dogs as some sort of misunderstood outcasts

They view capitalism and "liberty" as the great equalizer because there is nothing left to sell.
