But I lost my phone in the process... which is really not ideal when touring abroad. üò•  I'm confident it will be found, or I will find another way through. But this sucks. I suffer for my art.

They have to stay scared and project fear to protect ego. https://twitter.com/mike_andelman/status/1443001582996623362

I am not convinced that the actions of governments' around the world saved more lives than they destroyed over the last 18 months.  It's feasible that them doing absolutely nothing would have led to a similar or better overall result - all things considered.

* [10 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210810033126/https://twitter.com/ZubyMusic/status/1424936351372390424) ([live](https://twitter.com/ZubyMusic/status/1424935537316704267)): Best you can do is maintain a healthy bodyweight, eat well, exercise, and get enough sleep.  Supplement vitamins D, C, and zinc to boost your immune system.  And take therapeutic drugs if you think you need them (that's YOUR choice).  The rest is a farce... Go live your life.

Fear is bad for your health and anxiety cripples your immune system.  People are so afraid of dying, that they've stopped living.
* [10 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210810033126/https://twitter.com/ZubyMusic/status/1424936351372390424) ([live](https://twitter.com/ZubyMusic/status/1424934536425709574)): There are millions of people who have taken EVERY precaution and still been infected.  And there are millions of people who have taken NO precautions and haven't been.  And billions in between. None of this stuff is effective. You're just prolonging the anxiety.

This virus does not give a crap and is going to be endemic and infect most of you eventually.  Your politics, masks, and hashtags don't matter!

Yet they all say, 'I'm glad I got it though!'  What a cope.  May as well have gotten the rona itself. It's the same symptoms. üòÇ
* [ 2 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210802223404/https://twitter.com/ZubyMusic/status/1422324830469242880) ([live](https://twitter.com/ZubyMusic/status/1422322734776860676)): It's a minority that experience anything severe (just like the virus) but it's messed up that people are afraid to speak honestly about their own experiences.  Well done to those who created such a hostile atmosphere.
* [ 2 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210802223404/https://twitter.com/ZubyMusic/status/1422324830469242880) ([live](https://twitter.com/ZubyMusic/status/1422322164389355526)): A lot of people have had bad reactions from the rona jabs...  But they're afraid to say so because they don't want to be labeled as 'anti-vaxxers', or feel like they made the wrong decision.  The psychology at play is more interesting than the virology.
* [ 2 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210802210140/https://twitter.com/ZubyMusic/status/1422301574735540233): Thing is, if the vax works and you have confidence in it, this makes zero sense.  It's clear many people just want others to conform to their demands and they're hiding it has caring about 'health'.  Or they doubt the vax themselves and need social validation for their decision. https://twitter.com/jmglobalaffairs/status/1422298433646481411

And the average age of a 'Covid related death' in most developed countries is 80+  All death is sad, but saying we've overreacted is a gross understatement.
* [ 1 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210801002245/https://twitter.com/ZubyMusic/status/1421627375662608387) ([live](https://twitter.com/ZubyMusic/status/1421622447321792519)): 60 million people die every year and this has been the case for a long time.  Nobody cared. Most don't even know this stat.  Yet people now use ~4 million Covid related deaths in 18 months to blackmail, threaten, and defend stupid policies.  Didn't care 'til the TV told them to.
