RBG’s analogy to a “skim milk” marriage was better by a mile than anything we or any of the other lawyers had used to describe Edie’s marriage under DOMA in the dozens of briefs in the case.
* [19 September 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200919123316/https://twitter.com/kaplanrobbie/status/1307295640704122882): She subsequently told me that people had told her afterwords that they thought it was the single best thing that she ever had said or would say from the bench.

When she said “skim milk marriage,” it was clearly unplanned, made off the cuff, but directly from her heart. I remember people responded with laughter, but it was the kind of laughter that expressed moral clarity/relief.

She understood what a “full milk” marriage means. Like Edie, she had helped to nurse her spouse through a serious illness (in Marty’s case, cancer; in Thea’s case, MS).

I am also Jewish. My client Edie Windsor, who helped to win marriage equality nationwide, was also Jewish. So was her spouse, Thea Spyer.
