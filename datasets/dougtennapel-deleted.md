What's her CHARACTER? Having two white light sabers is not a character. Having snake ears is not a personality trait. Being a student of an even more cardboard Jedi is not a show.

There are many real tragedies of the artistic temperament, tragedies of vanity or violence or fear.

But in artists of less force, the thing becomes a pressure, and produces a definite pain, which is called the artistic temperament.

It is healthful to every sane man to utter the art within him; it is essential to every sane man to get rid of the art within him at all costs.

Making bank on VeggieTales at 48 years old doesn't explain how I was drawing 12 hours a day making $4300/year when I was 22 years old.

They're strawberries and mustard. Rion would have been great to develop his own Star Wars side project along the lines of Looper and Brick. He's a great story teller, just not Skywalker material.

Star Wars has been milked dry, though Rogue One added some grit and humor.

It didn't need to be Star Wars at all to work. Baby Yoda could be any green alien baby and the Mando could be any bounty hunter.

That's a normal response, but the firehose of hatred doesn't stop, silence just encourages an even bigger dogpile. To punch back is fine.

Comics treat artists as disposable. When someone does 150 pages in a year, it's a year of someone's life. That work should be hard bound not printed on TP.

All of the shipping calculations were based on what similar books cost to ship to your country. It's outrageous, and that's what your company costs.
