It cannot happen to *any* President of the USA and undermine us across the world. It was a hoax then as it‚Äôs being concluded now. https://www.thedailybeast.com/us-intel-walks-back-claim-russians-put-bounties-on-american-troops

Otherwise, since you‚Äôre in the ‚Äúmedia‚Äù, try asking your own party leaders about these issues and leave ours alone. https://twitter.com/chenweihua/status/1380067284035764231

States like AR, who've been open and are working hard, and deserve priority. Those who are closed? They won't get money until 2021, per CBO. Open up, get kids back to 5-day weeks.  #OpenTheSchools  pic.twitter.com/SWsWdoq3DN

Not a single Republican amendment was adopted and while I appreciate the Chairman‚Äôs cordiality, we cannot be boxed out of the process. American food security is non-partisan.

However, I believe there can be farmer-funded testing and quarantine mandates for travelers put into place which would alleviate these concerns. (Cont‚Äôd)

He could have done more, sooner. But, he can‚Äôt because the radical left controls his every move. This kind of political shakedown is disgusting. pic.twitter.com/JwbdOM9V5k
