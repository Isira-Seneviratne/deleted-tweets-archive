They just want free speech for ex-Muslims, but not Whites.

Exciting that we'll begin 2018 by building bridges and continuing to professionalize our movement.

Irish lasses love the potato. Do you want to fly there together or solo?

I wish them well but we had irreconcilable differences on what the relationship with the rest of the  #AltRight  should look like.   However, I'm not going anywhere. Stayed tuned, lots of exciting things planned.
