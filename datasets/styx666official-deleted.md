If a person is too young to get a credit card, loan, vote, buy guns, etc, they're too young to make such an irreversible decision. This is also why infant circumcision must be banned.

Things for which identifying oneself is important- taking out a loan, perhaps, or voting.  Not for eating a burger or hearing a talentless rock band rehash the hits of the 1970s.

Soycucks with no guns aren't exactly going to disarm me. They just fantasize about dudes with guns doing so. Because they are pathetic dross.

The 4th not to emails or any electronic correspondence? The 10th not to any state that did not exist in the late 1700s?  And you think I should own several grapeshot swivel guns?  Enjoy!

Shootings were at a 50 year low in the USA in the late 2010s until socioeconomic issues due to COVID. This despite a reduction in gun control- the spread of shall-issue permits and Mcdonald vs Chicago/Heller vs DC.

And AR15s are hardly the monstrous baby killing "weapons of war" the ignorant believe they are. Their prevalence in shootings is due to their popularity, not their design or specs.

Interestingly it is explicitly unconstitutional for DC to become a state unless you intend to create a new autonomous capitol. The whole point was to keep the capitol from any state government coercion.

Or if you have a firearm because you live in a rural area and a bear might smash into your garage?  Or if you're a girl who has to walk home late at night?

This is also why most explosives fall outside the 2nd amendment for some purposes and require training, permits, etc. But no semi-auto, revolver, bolt action, etc, should.
* [23 March 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210323111355/https://twitter.com/Styx666Official/status/1374318267590979586): The world can never be made totally safe and people should guard themselves. 911 comes in 15 minutes but .357 comes in 15 milliseconds.

Interesting historical fact: Gun crime was less prevalent back before there was meaningful gun control because if you whipped out your gun chances are ten were staring back.

As soon as white people get killed by some lunatic all of a sudden your NIMBY ass demands action.

That which does exist is largely relegated to a handful of large cities- all of which have considerable firearm ordinances.  Mostly it involves handguns used by gang bangers.

The militia is the population at large which comprises the citizenry able to muster arms- this precludes those under 18, those who are lunatics, and those who are quite physically infirm. The guard is just a semi-adjacent component of the US military (regulars.)

This was written due to such forced quartering by the government the colonists formerly had, namely the British.  I fail to see how this evinces your stance.

Everyone agrees with this. But they are fooled by the football team mentality of modern politics so few see all of the problematic ideas at once.

The "militia" cannot refer to soldiers because "regulars" was the only term used in the late 1700s for standing forces. And "well regulated" in late 18th century parlance transcribes to "well able to operate" IE supplied and skilled.

There is no such thing as "sensible gun legislation" as the 2nd explicitly provides for a civilian populous armed with military weapons and supplies.

Wage hikes will not make the poor less poor, it will simply compact the poor with the working and lower middle classes and make a considerably larger lower class that will have only vaguely more wealth and no mobility.

She also tried to claim Nancy Mace lied, when her tweet about evacuation had nothing to do with the second building being attacked- therefore her "nobody stormed the hallway" tweet does not contradict.

The militia is not military; if the military were the subject of the 2nd, it would have used the term "regulars." The militia is explicitly and only private citizens.  "Regulated" in 18th century parlance means "able to function."

A riot involving arson was underway and the order was given to disperse.  The dude just stood there like a moron.

There is no systemic racism in the United States.  2. Police brutality exists and must be addressed, but burning your own city down won't help.  3. Leftists don't want you to know what happens to "protesters" in left wing nations like China or Venezuela.

There are precious few nazis around. Plenty of commies and socialists though trying to seize power.

If more money is allocated, so is more power, by the state. Simple as.

But, nice opportunistic attempt.

That title better fits the political movement currently applauding mob rule and proclaiming that I should be disarmed and censored.

The initial outrage over police brutality has been all but completely hidden by a far left, entitled, BS mob of rock throwing, violent thugs.

You don't need to be a fascist to oppose tyranny. I'm a libertarian and still do. Sort of what libertarianism tends to entail.  Fuck commies.

Either you actually believe it (and are funny because you are ignorant) or you don't (and are funny because you are a shill.)

One that cannot prosecute people for defending themselves against rioting thugs.

If you conflate that with fascism you have just proven that the educational system desperately needs reform.

I edit and write books and communicate with several hundred thousand people a day indirectly.  Dumb commie.

Clouds always have a silver lining.
* [31 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200531121327/https://twitter.com/Styx666Official/status/1267066634931503106): You're supposed to oppose the idea of letting rioting thugs burn down small businesses and randomly attack onlookers.  As for VICE screw em. Defamatory bastards.

They literally don't care about life in general, and are being fed in their bloodlust and desire to go mad by leftist politicians which applaud them and are openly declaring them "rebels."

Everyone else sympathizes with Floyd and the community, and thinks burning the city down is "unhelpful."

Read his tweet a couple more times, preferably while meditating and trying to get through the intoxicating haze of corporate swill propaganda being spewed out by people at the moment.

No they aren't. They're called criminals.

I am saying that most claims of racism and bigotry are hyperbolic pearl clutching.

His campaign and the entire legacy media scramble to label it a "joke" but have all had people banned for the same kind of joke. (DM)  #Biden   #YouAintBlack

* [22 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200522194457/https://twitter.com/Styx666Official/status/1263918768033579010): Yes by rejecting your tired baloney from the 2000s.

I realized what a scam it is and how much I disliked socializing and societal convention and dropped out a year shy of graduation, with almost as many credits as a graduate.  And I am extremely thankful I did.

The executive branch has precious little true influence over budgeting except for pentagon discretionary spending which Trump had to spend two years litigating to even use because of obstruction.
* [22 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200522193931/https://twitter.com/Styx666Official/status/1263917400136744960): They should not be paying for development either.

It can use taxpayer money directly (Budgeting) or indirectly (inflating currency, shaving a fraction of value off everyones' money- AKA an indirect tax.)
* [22 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200522192841/https://twitter.com/Styx666Official/status/1263914672648007683): So Trump represents you and is paying for this?

* [22 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200522190935/https://twitter.com/Styx666Official/status/1263909866869002251): Very interesting that you would back the Russians on this issue since that is why we're leaving the treaty- their noncompliance.

Sad that it will be censored out of existence soon for misinfo. Trust me, store everything locally.

He'll defeat his nemesis- his clone, Joe Biden! He will do this with the help of people who are highly melanated, and punish those who resist him by making them pale.  He will be aided by his converted former nemesis, corn pop.

Indeed, people who do that or own only a few basic properties encompass most of these supposedly evil, horrendous people.  Few of them by the way are rich.

People need to stop letting fear get the best of them; when they are afraid they hand more power to the corrupt.
* [22 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200522173429/https://twitter.com/Styx666Official/status/1263885934237569025): This is why it is absolutely essential that government henceforth be banned from enacting such lockdowns.
* [22 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200522173234/https://twitter.com/Styx666Official/status/1263885454686007297): Believe it or not you have no specific right to prevent other people from engaging in basic activities based on your paranoia.  Wear a mask and disinfect your hands if you're afraid.
* [22 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200522173109/https://twitter.com/Styx666Official/status/1263885096135938048): Now that's SLIGHTLY hyperbolic.  But the basic idea is true; succeeding is partially about just having a good idea or sheer will. It does not always work but in capitalism at least you have a shot, unlike under far leftism, where everyone is just mediocre.
* [22 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200522172600/https://twitter.com/Styx666Official/status/1263883800280432643): Yeahhhhhhh not likely.

A billionaire rarely has a billion dollars. Likewise plenty of small chain owners, on paper, are millionaires.  Bernie is also rich.

Remove its power to help corporations create monopolies and skirt basic and meaningful workers and environmental protections.  We don't need an expansive government for that.
* [22 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200522171620/https://twitter.com/Styx666Official/status/1263881368683139072): So you think you can pay for it without either considerable new taxes, or inflating the currency?  What UBI would do is compact the lower, working, and middle classes together, whilst barely affecting the upper classes. Essentially you'd just have a much larger lower class.
* [22 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200522171226/https://twitter.com/Styx666Official/status/1263880387312398336): Ironically a disproportionate component of that taxpayer money being given to those firms is from the top 10% of income earners.  As well as people like me in the middle class who are self employed, who suffer a 15% tax penalty because government hates people taking initiative.
* [22 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200522171103/https://twitter.com/Styx666Official/status/1263880040883851270): I am concerned for others. If they are afraid of being infected they ought to stay home. Other people attending a church is no threat to them. By the way the first amendment is pretty explicit on religious freedom.  I'm not even a christian but thanks for stereotyping.
* [22 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200522165815/https://twitter.com/Styx666Official/status/1263876816886026240): "Allowed."  Interesting how the first amendment seems to have become ineffective at the moment.

* [22 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200522164815/https://twitter.com/Styx666Official/status/1263874300135817216): Yes: the people referenced in my initial tweet; namely, people rushing to defend Biden.

* [22 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200522163749/https://twitter.com/Styx666Official/status/1263871674069417985): That's great; and you speak for yourself- which is something Biden apparently finds difficult.
* [22 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200522162949/https://twitter.com/Styx666Official/status/1263869662607167494): Trying to virtue signal for some kudos?  lol

* [22 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200522162821/https://twitter.com/Styx666Official/status/1263869291545481217): Considering I was born in the lowest echelon of society, you'll excuse me if I laugh at your claim.  That nonsensical baiting might work on the middle classers but I was born in Appalachian poverty and had to work for my success.
* [22 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200522162645/https://twitter.com/Styx666Official/status/1263868889693331460): Says someone obsessed with fighting a "revolution" led by an elderly millionaire in politics since the mid 70s?
* [22 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200522162332/https://twitter.com/Styx666Official/status/1263868076577226752): Considering the government shut everything down, unilaterally suspending the first and fourth amendments, and preventing commerce and industry; yeah, you bet.  And liberals are trying to prolong this in states they control; Whitmer, Northam, et al.
* [22 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200522162123/https://twitter.com/Styx666Official/status/1263867540679393282): Why would you want the advice or opinion of a man who does not understand the concept of inflation, or the idea that this amounts to a soft form redistributionism which would destroy the middle class?  Also you ain't black.
* [22 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200522162019/https://twitter.com/Styx666Official/status/1263867270452871168): So you mean you now carry soy sauce in your pocketbook and not just hot sauce?  You crooked old bigot.
* [22 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200522161823/https://twitter.com/Styx666Official/status/1263866784127598594): Because preferably people will go back to work. Now that government has wrecked the economy it needs to get the hell out of the way.  Unfortunately this will be a lengthy and painful process even if we manage to keep opportunists like you from mucking it up.
* [22 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200522160931/https://twitter.com/Styx666Official/status/1263864554167119873): I am unconcerned with the virus these days. A great depression is far worse.

* [22 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200522160622/https://twitter.com/Styx666Official/status/1263863759765938176): Never heard of The Sisters of Mercy?  Casual.

* [22 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200522160441/https://twitter.com/Styx666Official/status/1263863335541489664): It will the moment Trump first enters it again after being re-elected.  Biden is a demented hack.
* [22 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200522160344/https://twitter.com/Styx666Official/status/1263863097262997504): Biden meanwhile has difficulty determining where on stage to stand when talking to a webcam.

Biden is ignorant because he is bigoted and demented, not because he is male, or white.
* [22 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200522155952/https://twitter.com/Styx666Official/status/1263862122741673986): Whataboutism

* [22 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200522154201/https://twitter.com/Styx666Official/status/1263857634140176384): And government has caused that to happen by creating artificial monopolies through differential legal treatment, grants and contracts, and anticompetetive legislation.
* [22 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200522154129/https://twitter.com/Styx666Official/status/1263857496659197952): The military is a role explicitly required under our constitutional system to be fielded by the government.  Government has ruined healthcare and education.

* [22 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200522152854/https://twitter.com/Styx666Official/status/1263854329884270592): Also I have plenty of student debt. I am not interested in you "cancelling" it because your plan to do so would steeply raise my taxes. My monthly savings from not having to pay the loans would be less than the new taxes you'd be adding.  No thanks to snake oil!
* [22 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200522152713/https://twitter.com/Styx666Official/status/1263853907387834370): No, it's not the time for that. It's time to open things back up and get government out of healthcare and education as much as possible so that the cost of both drops like a rock when government stops handing them taxpayer cash for more stadiums and elective courses.
* [22 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200522152332/https://twitter.com/Styx666Official/status/1263852979133779978): No, he was claiming that "you ain't black" if you don't support him in the election. And he was explicit about this belief.  And if he had an (R) after his name, literally none of you people running damage control for him wouldn't be calling for his ousting from politics.
* [22 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200522152144/https://twitter.com/Styx666Official/status/1263852525566013441): You claimed that a small study that partly refutes your own initial point was of importance. Subsequently, I am pointing out that this study lacks merit because it isn't scientific.  Neither study ultimately matters, but the former refutes your initial point explicitly.
* [22 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200524123747/https://twitter.com/styx666official/status/1263825635765637121): I know, she's elderly.

* [22 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200522151620/https://twitter.com/Styx666Official/status/1263851170524803074): Your initial claim on that thread is "Hydroxychloroquine bad!" which I refuted with the study itself.

The USSR peaked in nuclear strength in the 1980s; back in the 1960s the stocks available to the US and USSR were insufficient to glass the US and US citizens were prepared outside of urban centers, well armed and often with home bunkers.

Back in the mid 2000s Carlson had to say crazy shit to accomplish this. These days you just have to know about the dichotomy of sex chromosomes, or state that not all white people are bigots.

If it was you would not have used the plural "fans."  And I really do not care about what my audience has for personal beliefs- I have my own, and they either do or do not agree with my views on given issues and topics.

They blame Maduro  I think their grid is so poorly maintained after years of neglect that it might, strange as this may sound, be an utter coincidence. https://twitter.com/BNONews/status/1105272858228506625

I speak solely for myself. I believe in maximized personal freedom and leaving people alone. Only demented commies or the most hopelessly ludicrous evangelocons have an issue with my views.

And no, a non-workable plan like that isn't bringing anything anywhere, because it's BS.  Coulter should stop whining and attack the liberal and neocon obstructers.

I do care that it be arrived at through proper procedure so that it doesn't set a precedent giving undue power to a potentially abusive future incarnation of the government.

Remember back in 2015 when I chuckled endlessly as both Trumps most ardent fans and ardent foes both thought he was going to immediately kick out every immigrant and bring forth a ham-fisted nativist regime?

And eminent domain is normally BS but in the case of absolutely essential national security it's a necessary evil.

Trump has been shilled by the MSM for this entire period of time and yet has managed to make some headway already.  He needs more time. Since there's no alternative to him that isn't either neoliberalism or socialism, I'll probably vote Trump.

Push out the neocons and dems and wait for SCOTUS, especially after Ginsburg croaks.

Trump would be impeached and he knows it. He has to wait for SCOTUS.

This is why our personnel are disarmed even on their own bases.  Build Trumps' wall and the problem will be largely solved. To do that, get rid of the dems in congress.
* [ 9 March 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190309232400/https://twitter.com/Styx666Official/status/1104523232701501443): I've criticized Trump for his Syria strikes, continued Syrian occupation, his suggestion of reopening CIA black sites, and his failure to overhaul the ACA beyond repealing the mandate, among other things.  If you knew about my material you'd recognize this.

He has been obstructed all four times by congress and the 9th circuit.  Liberals like you are currently posing as "former Trump fans" to try and get actual Trump fans to abandon him on the mythical basis that this is his fault.
* [ 9 March 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190309232149/https://twitter.com/Styx666Official/status/1104522686632472576): Not viable. The dems are way too far out there to nominate someone with military service as a background.

Now try putting mortars and snipers on the Mexican border and wait and see how the world community reacts.  I don't want to be like Israel. I'm not interested in being run by paranoid nuke happy warmongers. We have enough neocons as is.

I voted for Ron Paul in 2012.  So you're either shilling or ignorant of my views.

Especially since parts of this barrier are in seismically active zones. A modular wall of that kind is far more easily defended and maintained.
* [ 9 March 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190309231329/https://twitter.com/Styx666Official/status/1104520585915367424): Not necessary. I prefer literature which is thought provoking and doesn't simply regurgitate things shilled on a discord server.

Trump is not physically able to unilaterally build his wall. Kick the dems and neocons out of congress and it'll be up in a year or less.

But the 9th circuit did. Trump has to wait for SCOTUS.  Illegal immigration is high because the economy has skyrocketed.

She won't admit that the real issue wall-wise has been nonstop obstruction by her good friend John McCain and other neocons, and then in the wake of the midterms, the 9th circuit and Democratic House.  Because that takes more effort to solve than "orange man sellout" https://twitter.com/drucurl/status/1104518745526059010

That does not compel me to want to support a party that would presumably scrap the very concept of peace in favor of more Clintonian imperialism.

And even though it would be out of malice, and even though Trump would be objectively correct, it would still be an effective obstruction and require SCOTUS.  Much like his attempt to fund the wall, which is still ongoing.

If she wanted to stop illegal immigration, she'd aim her criticism at the neocons that spent two years obstructing Trumps' repeated attempts to secure funding.

* [ 9 March 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190309225233/https://twitter.com/Styx666Official/status/1104515320864301056): Due to obstruction by RINOs like McCain.  Trump has to wait pending SCOTUS enabling his national emergency wall funding. I believe he will prevail but he needs time.
* [ 9 March 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190309225158/https://twitter.com/Styx666Official/status/1104515174726332417): The accelerationism thing is also a funny meme.  If you want the wall, take the effort to remove some of the worst obstructionists from congress.

I have little doubt that she's actually liberal in her views and does this mainly to provide a simple straw man for the left to beat on.

It already is.  Young voters don't have as much cash and don't have high turnout. The neglected Business Dems won't like the fact that the party is wasting time talking about BDS.

They can't win.

Ilhan Omar and AOC among other things have proven me 100% right. Expect their continued spiraling down the political toilet.

Secondary effects from said speech, however, are criminal if they victimize or are meant to victimize. Free speech as a legal and philosophical concept is specifically meant to prevent victimization by promoting discourse and dissent.

Only subsequent effects (real or intended) matter. So for example, incitement is illegal even if no victimization is taken due to the intent of said incitement.
* [ 6 March 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190306195347/https://twitter.com/Styx666Official/status/1103383165870268417): No. There are restrictions on victimizing others.  Incitement, harassment, and slander cannot be protected and were not protected at this nations' founding either.

All speech is lawful. However some speech (slander, harassment, incitement) can lead to secondary consequences which are not lawful. That's the litmus test and always has.
* [ 6 March 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190306192739/https://twitter.com/Styx666Official/status/1103376042704687104): Nope.

A few million doesn't turn into multiple billions without talent and effort.  Many politicians have worked hard- even the slimy corporate lawyers had to work to get those positions. On that even the scumbags are better than Sanders.

He can't even fathom basic economics.

And that's why the Democrats are quite likely to lose in 2020. Few of them seem to recognize this though and will just assume you're a MAGA hat wearing dedicated Republican if you point it out. pic.twitter.com/1e4YCWA8Fx

Whether this is primarily to cover Bernies' socialist ass or because of their larger ideology is often not immediately clear.

Denmark, Norway, and places like that are. They get those rankings because of enormous lengths of average schooling at great and inefficient expense.

A proper state can enforce voluntary contracts and this should be seen as a way to prevent corporatism and continue capitalism functioning properly. In other words no monopolies, trusts, etc

The oil there is state pumped and state shipped. In other words, the MAJORITY of the economy is state run in the most direct sense. Why are leftists so bad at understanding basic economic principles? Oh right they're leftists https://twitter.com/Kikasitsu/status/1100123997709180928

Ours would be the envy of the world if we eliminated federal intervention but then the population would be more aware of things and also demand employers pay them their fair value. And they'd reject leftism.

Socialism has historically collapsed every successive nation it has been utilized in, Capitalism is the biological norm for all intelligent beings.
* [25 February 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190225194810/https://twitter.com/Styx666Official/status/1100120263029673984): And that is a voluntary collective effort. In socialism it is involuntary at many levels of society.  Even the kinda-capitalism of the west is excessively centralized with licensing and bureaus and thousands of useless laws courtesy of leftists.
* [25 February 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190225193940/https://twitter.com/Styx666Official/status/1100118124328861699): Capitalism has no death toll. The concept that people should be able to own the means of production and be left alone has never started a war. Centralization causes war.
* [25 February 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190225193812/https://twitter.com/Styx666Official/status/1100117752780636162): That is the result of monopolization which only exists because government enables monopolies as the wealthy buy congress off.  That's centralization on the most mass level in human history- it isn't capitalism.
* [25 February 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190225193707/https://twitter.com/Styx666Official/status/1100117477944688640): It'd be kind of hard to invade with that few. I believe they will be used to help quell unrest if Venezuela breaks into civil war and millions of people begin fleeing across the border in a short time span.  Unless war actually happens there's no reason to complain.

If you're indicating a belief that they in any way operate under capitalism I'm at a loss for words.

Costs a huge amount.  So yeah tell them to fuck off and dismantle half our military then we can have all of Sanders' "FREE" (TM) shit- AKA shitty healthcare and education on mass taxation. Fuck socialism.

Monopolistic corporations enabled by our far left government embezzle based off war. Capitalism involves people simply owning productive capacity- like I do when I edit and self publish books, or market my videos. THAT is real capitalism.
* [25 February 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190225191646/https://twitter.com/Styx666Official/status/1100112297375289349): So he wants to centralize and publicly own multiple industries and massively raise taxes.  And if you think the dems would ever seriously try to get rid of citizens united you're amusingly simple.

* [25 February 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190225191312/https://twitter.com/Styx666Official/status/1100111401878806528): Maduro failed on his own and Chavez too by speculating on oil prices and borrowing against them, not recognizing the possibility of crude becoming too expensive to even pump without sophisticated equipment. Then nationalizing most industry.  A failure of centralization once again
* [25 February 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190225191146/https://twitter.com/Styx666Official/status/1100111038631026690): "Modern nations" hahaha nations that can afford that because they are in the US sphere and therefore need only limited military spending, because we defend them.
