Gov Stitt is pursuing a dangerous path regarding these so called ‚Äúcriminal justice reform laws‚Äù. His decision to opt the state into the refugee resettlement program is extremely unpopular.

Given Munoz‚Äôs long criminal record, it‚Äôs likely he was born here or else he would have faced deportation.   There‚Äôs another issue at hand, and we‚Äôll be discussing that soon enough.
