What happened to those innocent children of the parents... cults kill. I agree and feel the identity pol and marxist shit is quite common in MANY cults.... which is scary to see those two things so prominently in modern media. lol pic.twitter.com/NwUtF3qVrz

I felt like a weirdo though- being in Canada while America celebrated this big milestone. Kinda FOMO in a patriot way.  Canada is fun to pick on tho  First you get the moose...

Can't decide if a neck lanyard would look ok with anything I wear. Maybe it's all about the design. Regardless, it's super convenient. Kinda makes me look like I might have a decent job.

She was/is one of the hardest rocking musicians who sang about seriously taboo shit at the time. She is a super commercial broad but hard rocking nonetheless.  (Kurt also openly hit her. He was open about this. Jus' sayin' to GenX.)
