It’s a question of whether Trump can tell the public the truth about most things, including, as Woodward points out, a pandemic that has cost almost 200,000 Americans there lives.

The question of  @realDonaldTrump ’s fitness for office isn’t really a subjective question.  It’s not a question of opinion or taste.  It’s not like, should we spend more money on butter or guns, or how should we structure our tax system, and so on. https://twitter.com/60minutes/status/1305285171625721857

But it’s also a systemic issue that goes beyond Trump’s extraordinary narcissism. But if west coast votes actually mattered in this presidential election, you’d see both campaigns out there putting the problem front and center.
