And yet, every time one of my neighbors sets off a smoke alarm, no one has any problems evacuating and the fire department never is always somehow able to put out their kitchen fire.
* [28 May 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220528195105/https://twitter.com/AmySwearer/status/1530637742723547137) ([live](https://twitter.com/AmySwearer/status/1530635443976404992)): Urban liberals over here mocking Ted Cruz on door access policies as though they don't all live in large apartment buildings whose primary security features are one-way locking doors and a single main entrance for visitors.

But the "right to keep and bear arms?" That "shall be infringed."
* [26 May 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220526020855/https://twitter.com/AmySwearer/status/1529645582201012225) ([live](https://twitter.com/AmySwearer/status/1529644641326448640)): ...including, explicitly, the right to keep and bear their private arms for individual and communal defense.   Read D.C. v Heller. Read McDonald v. Chicago. Read David Kopel's 200 page masterpiece on it.    https://davekopel.org/2A/LawRev/19thcentury.htm

* [26 May 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220526020855/https://twitter.com/AmySwearer/status/1529645582201012225) ([live](https://twitter.com/AmySwearer/status/1529644638931492864)): The people may be called upon to exercise this individual right in a collective manner, and bring their privately owned arms to the organized defense of the state or nation against invasion, insurrection, or tyranny. But the right belongs to the people and shall not be infringed.
* [26 May 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220526020855/https://twitter.com/AmySwearer/status/1529645582201012225) ([live](https://twitter.com/AmySwearer/status/1529644637526401025)): People have rights. Governments have powers. We don't look at the First Amendment and read the "right of the people to petition the government" to mean some sort of state government authority to petition the federal government, because that would be silly and we all know this.
* [26 May 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220526020855/https://twitter.com/AmySwearer/status/1529645582201012225) ([live](https://twitter.com/AmySwearer/status/1529644635768987648)): You are not, in fact, reading the 2nd Amendment correctly. The right to keep and bear arms belongs "to the people," as individuals, which is the same understanding given to that phrase in every other part of the bill of rights. https://twitter.com/SundaeDivine/status/1529501770006806529

But still, these don't appear to be cheap guns. And not a whole lot of supporting evidence that this is a particularly hard-working and financially astute kid.
* [25 May 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220525132353/https://twitter.com/AmySwearer/status/1529453112032956417): I worked barely-above minimum-wage customer service jobs throughout high school. How does a kid who just turned 18, ostensibly went to high school, and worked at a small town Wendy's afford two ARs and body armor?
* [21 May 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220521031701/https://twitter.com/AmySwearer/status/1527850905076436992): You know it's a good night when the only photo you have from it is blurry.  #WeddingsAreFun   #DanceLikeThePhotoIsBlurry  pic.twitter.com/SXWh6YJQ4E

Also, Democrats have spent decades arguing that originalists shouldn't be confirmed. So why isn't the question whether THEY believe her?

McAuliffe either thinks you're stupid or he lacks the most basic understanding of gun violence. https://twitter.com/2Aupdates/status/1447433905926254595

We're not only okay with this, but we very vocally want it to happen.   You father a child and you are legally responsible for providing for that child [including prenatal care].  Yep. Very much the point. https://twitter.com/juliaioffe/status/1446113958650253313

The best response is to own it.  But...nope, she's definitely doubling down with the "indignantly tattletale on a fallen soldier's family getting a private tour" thing.  Sgt. Nicole Gee's family can do what it wants. https://twitter.com/heatherscope/status/1443586349831901191

The company is experiencing record growth and pays God knows how much to the state in taxes every year.   Massachusetts flipped them a giant middle finger. Smith & Wesson flipped MA a bigger one. https://twitter.com/Guntalk/status/1443570165480767490

Other days, your cats want cuddles,, your sister cleans your sad ass apartment, your friends are awesome, and you remember that someone will find you worth choosing.

I'd give a driver a straight $100 tip to take me right now.   Bed. I want bed. And I'll pay for it.

What they certainly knew that the Capitol was on lockdown, besieged by angry rioters who hadn't exactly gone through metal detectors to get there. They drew their guns on a national security threat.
