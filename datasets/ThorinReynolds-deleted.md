Born in Jamaica, appointed by Obama, and married fellow judge Jewish Peter Krauthamer.  https://twitter.com/reuters/status/1448400264638173189  pic.twitter.com/r9N4OSHatS

They’ll keep James Bond White, but they make all the supporting characters & themes diverse. Full replacement won’t happen until the franchise has been squeezed dry and they can spike the football over a corpse; like Playboy just did.

Traditional gender roles were designed to remove direct competition between the sexes while allowing smart men and women to both be successful in ways which complemented each other. https://twitter.com/GwendolynKansen/status/1425553043458863110
* [19 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210719185627/https://twitter.com/ThorinReynolds/status/1417196620056252417): Diversity is Israel’s greatest strength.  Israel must open its borders and accept millions of immigrants every year.  This is the only way for it to atonement for its original sin of settler colonialism.
* [ 9 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210709194313/https://twitter.com/ThorinReynolds/status/1413584530179514368): The rights to speech, assembly, and petition necessarily presuppose a public square to engage in these activities. When private entities like Twitter & Facebook take on the role of providing society’s public square then they must be forced to operate under the terms of 1st Amend.
* [ 8 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210708215508/https://twitter.com/ThorinReynolds/status/1413255279765032960): Rethinking the “Hey babe, wanna come back to my place and check out my giant Flammenwerfer” pickup line.

* [26 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210426181603/https://twitter.com/ThorinReynolds/status/1386745768795648005): @ColumbiaBugle  Imagine being the Republican Party and having this issue handed to you on a silver platter by the opposition and deciding to run Bruce Jenner in a dress on a fiscal conservatism platform instead.
* [26 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210426181402/https://twitter.com/ThorinReynolds/status/1386745331086417920): @VDAREJamesK  Imagine being the Republican Party and having this issue handed to you on a silver platter by the opposition and deciding to run Bruce Jenner in a dress on a fiscal conservatism platform instead.

* [26 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210426174316/https://twitter.com/ThorinReynolds/status/1386737533854302212): @HarmlessYardDog  How’s this for nightmare fuel?
* [26 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210426174316/https://twitter.com/ThorinReynolds/status/1386737533854302212): If this bill passes, then in Colorado it will be illegal to castrate a bull calf to produce tender steaks, but it will be a civil right to castrate your son because he thinks he is a girl. The evil insanity of Liberal morality. https://www.farmprogress.com/livestock/nations-eyes-colorado-meat-fight
* [26 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210426173237/https://twitter.com/ThorinReynolds/status/1386734867224961025): Finally, I’d like to point out the evil insanity of Liberal morality where castrating a bull calf to produce tender steaks is illegal, but castrating your son because he thinks he is a girl is a civil right.
* [26 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210426173237/https://twitter.com/ThorinReynolds/status/1386734867224961025) ([live](https://twitter.com/ThorinReynolds/status/1386734358426497027)): All three of those things are absolutely necessary to maintain the cheap widespread availability of rest meat we currently enjoy, but people are now so removed from the farm that many won’t realize that until it’s too late. That’s what these types of bills are counting on.
* [26 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210426173237/https://twitter.com/ThorinReynolds/status/1386734867224961025) ([live](https://twitter.com/ThorinReynolds/status/1386733260936564740)): Take for example a bill currently being pushed in Colorado under the guise of “animal cruelty” which would outlaw:  -artificial insemination of animals -castrating animals -butchering younger animals  This would effectively kill the Colorado beef industry. https://www.farmprogress.com/livestock/nations-eyes-colorado-meat-fight
* [26 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210426173237/https://twitter.com/ThorinReynolds/status/1386734867224961025) ([live](https://twitter.com/ThorinReynolds/status/1386732580653912066)): And if you can find real meat to buy it’ll be so expensive that it will quickly become a upper to upper-middle class luxury.  Disrupting the supply side of meat production is much easier, less intrusive, and a lot harder to come back from.
* [26 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210426173237/https://twitter.com/ThorinReynolds/status/1386734867224961025) ([live](https://twitter.com/ThorinReynolds/status/1386732086548123653)): I think a lot of people laughing at the Elites’ meatless society goals don’t understand that they’re not going to go after demand, they’re going to go after supply.  It’s not going to be illegal to eat a bunch of meat, it’ll simply be that grocery stores don’t stock beef anymore.
* [20 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210420234721/https://twitter.com/ThorinReynolds/status/1384654761455194115): Re: everyone saying “just move out of the Blue states/cities”  My nice white Republican county in Texas got hit by 10%-50% increases in property taxes this year. How long before normal people get priced out of white flight?
* [20 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210420161845/https://twitter.com/ThorinReynolds/status/1384542061500661765): 1) The Segregationists were right about everything.  2) Conflating 19th/20th century Southern Democrats with 21st Democrats is deeply insulting and blatantly dishonest.  Stop Boomerposting; no one on the Left cares and everyone on the Right cringes.
* [15 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210415160511/https://twitter.com/ThorinReynolds/status/1382726662668705792): Ethnic genetics are to nationality what genitalia/chromosomes are to gender; it’s an incomplete description, but whatever set you’re born with is what you are. The view this non-German is expressing is the transexual version of nationality. https://twitter.com/dingding_peng/status/1382287391310938116
* [30 March 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210330024411/https://twitter.com/ThorinReynolds/status/1376726860193792004): Can certainly argue that we got some of the specifics wrong (re: DnD), but with a homosexual rapper twerking on Satan & selling human blood sneakers being the center of mainstream culture this week, you can’t argue that Evangelical Christians were wrong about our trajectory.
* [11 March 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210311191740/https://twitter.com/ThorinReynolds/status/1370091545291022336): Today in “Creating new and convoluted tyrannical rules to avoid singling our foreign men as the problem”.

* [24 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210124221414/https://twitter.com/ThorinReynolds/status/1353466101296988161): Reminds me of how as a Southern racist I got along a lot better with the black students at my university than the Liberal Yankees did. Turns out that unless you're angling for social ladder-climbing that most people don't like being treated as something exotic to be fawned over.
* [ 8 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210108203032/https://twitter.com/ThorinReynolds/status/1347641750437953536): This is the one time in history were wearing a mask in public doesn’t arouse suspicion; take advantage of it.  Antifa are pros at this, learn from them: masks, hats, sunglasses/goggles, and no unique/identifiable clothing.
* [ 8 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210108203032/https://twitter.com/ThorinReynolds/status/1347641750437953536) ([live](https://twitter.com/ThorinReynolds/status/1347640807759687683)): Look I know that Conservatives have bizarrely picked the “Masks are Communism” hill to die on. But I hope that all the people having their lives ruined right now because they were easily recognizeable will convince people of the wisdom of spending $20 to buy a mask for next time. pic.twitter.com/Yy8VmqARUM
* [20 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201120215219/https://twitter.com/ThorinReynolds/status/1329905342554181632): Boomercons have been looking at these graphs for decades, feeling smug, & being like “we’ll just outbreed the libtards!”, while sending their kids to public schools.   Leftist reproductive strategy of stealing brainwashing kids may be parasitic, but it’s proven very effective.
* [17 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201117224222/https://twitter.com/ThorinReynolds/status/1328830787941265409): 2099 AD: US is being torn apart by civil wars, all major cities are no go zones ran by gangs, & Chinese have taken control of the Western coast. One of President Jamal Goldstein’s aides suggests bringing home troops from Afghanistan. “What!? It hasn’t even been a century yet!!!”
* [21 September 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200921024906/https://twitter.com/ThorinReynolds/status/1307874176993243139): Who could possibility see the pictures of urban Chinese packed into tiny apartments like ants in ugly skyscrapers after walking back through unbreathable smog from slave-tier jobs working for uncaring multinational corporations and go "Yeah, I want America to look like THAT!"
