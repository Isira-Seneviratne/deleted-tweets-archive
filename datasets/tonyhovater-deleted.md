I assume they're dumb, and that they're making an equally dumb point that was already dumb when people first started optics posting.

It leads to unhealthy relationships between men and women. An entire generation has had unlimited access to hardcore porn and look at how messed up they are. Do you support the banning of pornography?
* [12 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200712234518/https://twitter.com/TonyHovater/status/1282456201406697477): The runescape forum most be pretty wild.

It's to big and in the pocket of power for that to happen. It's going to always exist as a pressure release value for populism in America.   Yes a real option for white Americans should exist.

Trump's DOJ and FBI target right wingers constantly. He wants to give a pathway to citizenship to DACA recipients. He wants more legal immigrants than ever. Wants more H1bs ect.

They just change the colors of the paint job on "the ship of state". 2016 showed that while minor things may change its just as helpful as rearranging chairs on the titanic. The trajectory is still the same.

It's almost like some people would prefer revelations from her case to get lumped in with kook nonsense. Really makes you think. https://twitter.com/RichardBSpencer/status/1282149140734947330

I thought they were owned by the same big businesses, pro immigration, and Israeli lobbyists that control the Democrats as well. What a relief.

Amy would essentially bring nothing else to his campaign. Both of their core supporters picked the other as their 2nd choice. It's at least not a negative like Warren.

People use this particular event as a spook years after the fact and it's mind blowing to me. It's like 90% of people in our circles can only look backwards at 2016/17.

Also that America is anti white. The American economy will likely not be the unipolar force it was after this. He did it in a very Matt way and got a reactionary response.

You're obviously saying that the battle lines are ZOG(anti white) vs China. There's no reason to pick team ZOG in this fight if you're pro white.

Cville literally broke these people's brains. They were weak, and ignorant of what being a political dissident means, and what the costs would be.
