The shit they put in the water has these fucking idiots giving more credence to a 250 yr old parchment more than their fellow compatriots, nature and evolution. All of which are more real than some old hemp shit paper.

I have buckets of black walnuts ready to plant or eat now if anyone in 313 wants any. Humans and the deer eat them, and bloc can cut the trees down in 40 years and make a table -- or some bread. They also kill all the weeds in your yard.
