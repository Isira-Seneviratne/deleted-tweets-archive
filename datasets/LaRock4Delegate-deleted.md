A full year of treating the people of the Commonwealth like children is far to long already! https://twitter.com/capgaznews/status/1369388159369437188
* [13 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201113230817/https://twitter.com/LaRock4Delegate/status/1327387745921216515): It's Friday, the 13th, of November 2020 & the Governor this afternoon announced he intends to prohibit churches and any other meetings over 25 people from meeting again after this Sunday, no matter how big their facility is! I'm guessing, most likely at least through Christmas...  https://twitter.com/GovernorVA/status/1327352600065429510  pic.twitter.com/RWHBsbJhyt

It doesn't help that the Gov. continues to restrict churches. Please reach out for help if you need it! https://t.co/N4oNbVTfpk
