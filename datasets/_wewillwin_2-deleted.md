Why is Italy having such a hard time cremating bodies?  The Nazi's were able to cremate people at an unbelievable rate. Has cremation tech regressed in the last 70 years?  Ideas?

Grandpa preferred male kids. Dad is a man's man, but bought into equal rights. Wouldn't have made a difference, they're a team, she's in charge. She's a midwit but thinks she's smart.   Everyone is a narcissist to mom. 🤔
