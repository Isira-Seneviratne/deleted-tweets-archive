We know when the fiscal year begins – every year it’s Oct 1st – and instead of getting our work done, we play politics, we delay, and we blame. (1/3)

The U.S. will lose nearly a million jobs by 2020 and $700 billion in GDP by 2030.  @POTUS , reverse your decision immediately! pic.twitter.com/LOpu0lmalb

But this lawsuit would hurt countless jobs, including in his district.
