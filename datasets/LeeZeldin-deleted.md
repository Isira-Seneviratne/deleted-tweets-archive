As Hochul now refers to NYers as her Apostles, we are reminded of how out of touch she is with reality & how drunk she has become with her new powers.

They even received parades. Today, in Kathy Hochul’s New York, many of them were fired. It didn't have to be this way, especially with the availability of PPE and testing, natural immunity and other factors. pic.twitter.com/MhlJZSj4x2

Cuomo mandated the COVID vaccine for SUNY, CUNY & community college students! I STRONGLY DISAGREE with this order, but you need to make your voice heard as well.
