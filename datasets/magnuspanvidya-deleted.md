* [25 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210525034728/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1397035513643679744): Words are hard and spooky lol but yeah, it's a combo of not letting others breathe and being married to old ideas, and some newer people just being like Rothbard 1.04721
* [25 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210525041946/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1397034782400421888): Maybe a bit, but you get my point.
* [25 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210525034242/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1397033780192350214): And I think it's because so many people are married to Hoppe and Rothbard  Great Men theory
* [25 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210525033824/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1397031153039777792): Among their circles? Huge. Goldman closed down clubs and gave speeches, Rothbard is massive.  A lot of the Austrian economics folks people keep linking to me aren't even known within a lot of Libertarians and AnCaps, let alone outside of it.
* [25 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210525035134/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1397032418217955330): UPB is nice, it's the race and IQ, border stuff and the Trump sucking that gets me  Like I said, baggage, makes it harder for it to go anywhere
* [25 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210525033645/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1397030530055655428): I agree
* [25 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210525034545/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1397029608248205313): And this worship actually makes it harder for these newer people to get a footing and known
* [25 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210525034623/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1397030959778783239): Yeah I agree with Malice that it's kinda dead and pointless
* [25 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210525033247/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1397030789460733953): I think if he started writing theory he's definitely smart enough in educated enough to make a modern theoretical framework, that's just not really what he does though, nor does it seem to be his goal, he's too good at doing other things
* [25 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210525033645/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1397030530055655428): I'm not his biggest fan and I give him full credit of being a Libertarian and an anarchist, I don't feel the need to exclude someone from an ideology because I don't like their beliefs
* [25 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210525032815/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1397030295178727424): I think y'all kind of misunderstand what exactly malice does, he's not really a theory guy, if anything he's a salesperson, which is important and not to diminish whatsoever, I absolutely love him, but he's not writing books on new anarchist theory, he's explaining old ones
* [25 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210525032345/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1397029961438011392): Malice is up there in terms of spreading the idea, maybe the best at it, but he's not really creating new theory, and his number #1 book is just explaining all these old theories to normies
* [25 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210525034545/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1397029608248205313): I mean I'm not ignoring, but obviously nobody's knocked it out of the park to be broadly known and platformed enough for their ideas.  Like I said other places in this thread is not to diminish anyone's work, if anything is  throw shade at people who worship old ideas religiously
* [25 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210525033132/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1397029198049562625): Based

* [25 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210525010222/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1396992690869395460): Theory is fluid got to keep it moving
* [25 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210525010222/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1396992690869395460): Oh yeah, I didn't intend to devalue anyone's work or say that people aren't TRYING  But for as many new people there are, and as many people that respect them, there's way more people that worship the ground Goldman or Rothbard walked on
* [25 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210525010246/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1396992311654076418): The point is to not base your entire worldview around them, the point is to do exactly what you're saying here, but many people are churchgoer level devoted to some of these ideas in their entirety
* [25 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210525011320/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1396987169865191425): All my shit is stolen from Hess and Bookchin hahaha
* [25 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210525003027/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1396986989250060293): @Mike_Nichols Absolutely, speed and scope sound like simple things but you got to keep in mind a lot of calculations on how the world would work were based on certain things being impossible due to the scope and speed required to do them  We can do that now
* [25 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210525013940/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1396986508104638464): This is another tweet that I feel is very straightforward but people are going to bumblefuck around and misunderstand  >-Popular<- if they're not widely known doesn't count   Then people link me others who just repeat theory from people who are dead with no updates to the theory
* [25 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210525031048/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1396984940991074307): Don't like Hoppe, or most the stuff he asserts, and he's still an ancient boomer man who doesn't understand the full applications of the internet.  Molyneux's UPB is pretty alright but it's not widespread and it comes with all the other baggage of stuff he believes.
* [25 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210525005808/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1396984544964845569): I don't, it still be updated however, the internet fundamentally changes human interaction and how we interface with the world, economics, society, culture, and none of these people were alive to even fathom its existence
* [25 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210525011317/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1396984117443665921): Big things coming at 9PM EST, stay tuned, you're not gonna wanna miss this üòè   #YouAreThePower   #SomethingBigIsComing  https://twitter.com/RealSpikeCohen/status/1396978150152810497

* [25 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210525001949/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1396981910312820737): The last popular anarchist philosopher died in 2006.  Meaning there has been no widespread theory produced that is contemporary to the current situation humanity finds itself in.  So while Kropotkin, Proudhon and Rothbard are good sources and valuable, so far little fully applies
* [24 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210524232229/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1396969291963117573): Wait, no way

* [24 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210524231106/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1396966942766944260): Follow Dustin to make him mad https://twitter.com/DirtyAnarchist/status/1396960162368434181

* [24 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210524225114/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1396960852805292032): The federal government, through property taxes
* [24 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210524224538/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1396960529718169600): Thank you for putting that in a much better way than I could
* [24 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210524224257/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1396959707466813442): Yes it's not a structural system, or a law, but a means to view the world, hoping that increasingly people would not find the desire or willingness to hold property they're not actively using, never to forcefully take it from them
* [24 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210524224124/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1396959343237545993): This is not to say that the person who owns a two-story house off the back of their labor they saved up to buy illegitimately holds that property, but it is to say that a lot of the larger foundations, have been built off of an illegitimate start point
* [24 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210524224124/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1396959343237545993): I mean it's a constant meme that's talked about in libertarian circles and even on the internet, I'll increasingly people are living in apartments and not actually owning their homes. Generationally it gets worse by the day.
* [24 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210524224113/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1396958678041960449): And by abstain tea property I mean that I'm a mutualist and that I agree in the concept they push not the means they would go about applying it
* [24 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210524224113/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1396958678041960449): Yeah I don't agree with them, as someone who believes in absentee property.  It is a morality and a world view, a way to handle situations, and a code to live by, not a strict structure. Same with the NAP. People just get weird about it.
* [24 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210524223712/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1396958107356516352): The rate of property ownership is dramatically reducing, almost exponentially, due to everything being built on top of this house of cards that was started illegitimately.   This is why the anti-federalists and Americans fled further and further west, because it started this way
* [24 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210524223349/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1396957338481922050): This shit is so weird and gross lol  Like congrats on your weird religion with extra steps in the opposite direction with the same outcome lol
* [24 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210524223151/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1396956597600063492): Da

* [24 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210524222134/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1396952667826556929): My dream is a cooperative living apartment right next to a privately owned hardware store that rents out the rooms above it.  Consent is all that matters
* [24 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210524222433/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1396953341918425091): I agree, but you have to boil it down to the concepts in the state of the world, and just ditch all of the labels and words that people argue over to avoid the concepts
* [24 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210524222532/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1396952833308692483): She's arguing for it from a very different perspective than you are, so that's not what's going on here
* [24 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210524222134/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1396952667826556929): Yeah that's where I flow naturally in my mutualist little bubble, having once been both a big Libertarian and a Marxist leninist lol
* [24 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210524221942/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1396952270114275332): Banger thread in terms of theory and concepts, however I usually do get really weird when people play with terms because language is so contextual and hotly debated over

* [24 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210524221957/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1396950329191800842): And that's is actual anarchism.

Which is annoying, and leads to a pointless argument over words which are a spook.
* [24 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210524222637/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1396946134845829121): Because even in your example you reveal a bias, you assume every kind of business is a factory, that is not how this works.  But this is a 100 year old debate between anarchists and it's not going to be solved with a character limit so I'm pretty much over this conversation.
* [24 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210524220044/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1396946524215644162): I mean if we want to play squirrely with the word till the end of the time to where we only get it down to where people who also called themselves socialists are Anarchists then fine you can play that, but Im not interested in that define your terms how you wish I've defined mine
* [24 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210524215615/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1396946640012029959): Anarchism is a way of living and a way of viewing the world, not an end goal

* [24 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210524220539/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1396944675999784960): Okay but even they agree, which is a simple fact of the reality, that you cannot seize or forcibly remove them without forming a tyrannical state, instead they just act like Jehovah witnesses trying to convince people to join the co-ops, which is perfectly fine
* [24 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210524220037/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1396945287424401411): I'm going to mute this conversation because I've come to a helpful endpoint with everyone involved and I don't want to deal with my mentions being flooded

Where you have small privately owned businesses living right alongside anarchosyndicalist co-ops, and neither one of them want to piss the other off so they live in mutual respect and cooperation
* [24 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210524215347/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1396944420742828035): And we*

* [24 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210524220429/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1396944170888085508): Sick no other argument needed, you're not a universalist, and I respect your desires for how you want to live and your system üíú  Have a good day comrade.
* [24 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210524220347/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1396942915629371394): I agree that it's not possible under this system, but with the removal of the state it will be possible even if other people are participating in concepts of property
* [24 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210524222030/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1396943687721041930): Okay, so if some people dissociate and go form a capitalist/market village for example in the middle of nowhere you'll just leave them alone if they leave you alone, cuz if yes, then why are we arguing lol
* [24 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210524220131/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1396943447622291459): Yeah that whole socialist argument that you're not a capitalist you're a worker? That applies universally, to where people that want this aren't all going to immediately reform tyrannical States and systems  They'll probably have a small homestead and maybe a small business lol
* [24 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210524220347/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1396942915629371394): If anything the only major hurdle these places run into our state interference through property tax and regulation, not property

* [24 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210524213401/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1396941391083753473): Y'all think you're arguing with an ancap when you're not that's the best part lol

* [24 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210524213401/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1396941391083753473): So tell me what you will do to me in your system, I go out into the woods, I build myself a house, I begin to use my sculpting skills to make art, I will not give them to you, if you ask I will tell you no, and if you attempt to steal them from me I will defend myself
* [24 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210524222141/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1396941954341089283): Hey you're the one who came here, the doors right there whenever you want it, grab some theory seeming you maybe once read two pages of Kropotkin üíúüå∫

* [24 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210524213401/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1396941391083753473): Impossible, again, universalist, in your worldview I cant go out into the woods, and own commodities, and produce my commodities, and refuse to give them to you if you don't pay for them, and of course in the most anarchistic way possible you'll just kill me if I don't do obey üòé
* [24 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210524213224/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1396940901331709957): Mine

* [24 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210524213224/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1396940901331709957): I have lived on a commune, I have lived on an extremely remote rural subsistence living area, and I have obviously lived under this capitalist system  I do not want the capitalist system, and I do not want your communal system, I do in fact want to work or die on my own merits
* [24 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210524214932/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1396939121969569797): Or you could just go start doing stuff, seeming there seems to be nothing more pedantic and proving my point than arguing about the amount of people doing things when I'm complaining that people are spending more time talking than doing things
* [24 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210524212859/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1396939883541839876): No I don't assume that, in fact I believe there's quite a few people that would love that system you describe, and quite a few people that do not want to live in the system you describe, and these are both facts and acceptable terms of reality in my worldview.
* [24 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210524213910/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1396940335444529156): Do self-employed, single employee being the owner, businesses exist in your worldview, am I a figment of my own imagination, do I not own a business with no employees that I work for myself?   Lop

* [24 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210524221115/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1396939643078291457): I don't care about this system, I care about my own system, that I will implement later on, that will be of my own and for just myself, and will respect those around me and will continue peacefully, and if you interject on that to enforce your ideology you're not an anarchist
* [24 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210524214932/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1396939121969569797): You're expanding the analogy to make to make it work losing the point.  If something has to be done and no one is doing it, people need to suck it up and do it.  We have  innumerable thought leaders and podcasts runners and think tank organizers, the very small group of doers
* [24 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210524212407/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1396938418060414977): I mean no one will, if everyone universally rejected it that'd be a paradox  It's just insane how common the belief is.  Live and let live

* [24 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210524214952/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1396933659869990919): Universalism is the most poisonous and dangerous line of reasoning  And the most common  It infects socialists, liberals and anarchists  There will be people who do not want to live in your system, your culture, your economic structure, your region, or within your moral code 1/2

It's like walking into a room with five people and saying "who is the hole watcher and who's the hole diggers?" And all of them say watcher, then say "well we need watchers!"

In any anarchist society, I will continue to be an artist, continue to produce art, I will continue to want to make art for other people, and continue to want to be paid for that time. That's a market.

It's perfectly okay to address one or a small number of issues at a time.  But it seems people can't resist "oh we need to address this, and also this, and this one thing is my pet issue" etc.

* [ 7 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210509061557/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1390548688439754752): But to me that just sounds like mutualism with extra steps

* [ 7 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210507060153/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1390547274699259904): Right but as I said elsewhere, business and land is different.  A business must make profit, to pay employees etc. You can just sit on land, without taxes, forever. Till someone agrees to your terms to use/buy it
* [ 7 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210507060105/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1390547064518549505): This is an issue in Detroit, where banks have sat on vacant property, for years, with no taxes on it, refusing to sell something that isn't worth 2g for anything less then 20. Why we have more vacant buildings then occupied ones.

Right now, if I own land, I have to pay taxes on said land, so if land is not paying for itself, I have to get rid of it.  In a taxless society, there is nothing stopping me from just buying land and sitting on it.

* [ 7 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210507055349/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1390545234094960643): People would totally be willing to sell if the price is right, if not, if everything around them is owned by the would be buyer, according to AnCap principle they can enact whatever restrictions they wish for them to even LEAVE their property.

Especially when you consider realestate

* [ 7 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210507051235/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1390534872222031874): That item is illegal to own. You can't just sell it.

As in not in use by the individual property  This is the main split between us and anarchists.  Reason being, the wealthiest people in the world have nothing stopping them from buying up most of the land on earth

It'd be easier to me to just say "fuck the NAP till we win but don't be a fucking tyrant about it"  Mutualists do this in Syria now, in the same way, without it.
* [ 7 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210507015117/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1390474232413495296): pretty much around the area I work in, with some notable differences, but the general idea.

* [ 7 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210507012308/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1390475563043799045): I mean, you shoot a mortar at a police station, fragments break my window a block away, you violated my NAP I don't help the state, I'm not on their side, and I might not be on yours, but you damaged my property and thus aggressed.
* [ 7 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210507011715/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1390474851182329858): My main thing which you already answered is that you can't really call for revolution and believe in the NAP, post revolution yes, but it's simply impossible to fight a war in any form of competent way without violating it.
* [ 7 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210507012541/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1390471088774254593): What happened is say what you're saying now, but in a smug ass tone lol.

As you have your space, and you only defend it when attacked, or do you retaliate? Do you use force to end the aggression? Sabotage, hitting of hard targets, etc.
* [ 7 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210509044736/https://twitter.com/MagnusPanvidya/status/1390473273033596929): Okay I didn't think about the fact Crypto wasn't illegal when it started, so that's a fair point.

Does it have any at all? The only I've ever seen is stealing from agorism or "lol Boog time"  Don't start fights over "lol it isn't real" or other debates in my mentions.

The BEST case you can hope for is having a lethal and non-lethal on you at all times, which most cops do now, they just don't always use it.

Avoiding that happening is the fight

The issue isn't what happens after the gun is pulled, a lot of cases of what a cop does while shooting is exactly what you need to do with a weapon.  The issue is how often they go to the gun in the first place. Way, too, fucking, often.

AR's and Handguns are gas operated weapons. They require the redirection of the explosive forces to properly cycle a round.

That's what the green is.

If you are ever in a situation where the best way to guarantee your safety is a gun, the most legal option is to mag dump.

Warning shot laws:   Many people say, just fire a warning shot into the ground! This is also illegal in most states. A round fired into the air (not a good idea in general but still) or in a safe area away from target can result in criminal charges.

This is illegal in several states.

Even in cases of the perp being armed and breaking into someone's home or even assaulting someone.

Volunteerism is mostly a term that has come up to replace anarchy due to the word anarchy being blown apart into 100 meanings depending on who you talk to.  Volunteerism however focuses more on consensual relationships.

Anarchy means without rulers, that extends both to the government and the rule of the majority.  Making actual anarchism neither left nor right.

I don't think literally everything he did was awful, but the bad things he did do are the ones that stuck.

As a 2A advocate, these alone are unacceptable.  And that doesn't even go into his comments about making flag burning a federal crime.

I won't become authoritarian in my opposition to authoritarianism.
