Studying the Russian Revolution, the Tzar made multiple concessions to the bolsheviks/mensheviks/socialists. Thus, concessions often exacerbate the conflict, not dispel it.

Volunteering, even showing up to ‘boring’ meetings. Its not immoral or sneaky. You actually care about the welfare of your neighbors, and youre right to be cautious, esp today.

Step 2 is to take the mental approach that youre not there simply for ‘revenge’ youre there to represent and edify the will of real Americans, which is better than revenge. https://twitter.com/dqiuxtoe/status/1122615171694727168

Basically, a boycott for boycotts.

Posters are made, lists of potential protesters are kept and phoned/contacted and the thing is planned like a trip to the beach. People take pics and outsource them to social media/news.
* [27 May 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20180527015122/https://twitter.com/AndrewQuackson/status/1000555022512467968): Analyze how Publix operates. It has stores, open to the public. Organize a "sit in" where people lay on the floor. Theres mild risk, one can be trespassed from the property, but that would require Publix calling the police and even a public disturbance charge carries very little.

Power via stripping funding from an organization, the NRA, by cutting off a source of its sustenance. How, exactly? By pressuring companies who are partnered with the NRA to cease their partnership/donations etc.
