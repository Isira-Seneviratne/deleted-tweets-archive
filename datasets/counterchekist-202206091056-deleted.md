* [ 8 May 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220508072630/https://twitter.com/counterchekist/status/1523202626120151040): 2 wrongs don‚Äôt = right.   Holding Russia accountable for its bad behavior in cyberspace is just a laughable as holding them accountable for atrocities in Ukraine @ UNSC. Never going to happen.   That said, imitating their behavior w/o authorization is wrong, too.

US/NATO assistance, while critical and necessary, only enhances the Ukrainian‚Äôs fight to be free from tyranny and oppression.   And they‚Äôre giving the Kremlin the a‚Äî kicking it deserves. https://twitter.com/AVindman/status/1522390875879485441

You have a show on RT/Sputnik called ‚ÄúOrbiting the World with George Galloway.‚Äù Latest content was posted on April 2nd 2022.

* [23 December 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201223203423/https://twitter.com/counterchekist/status/1341844514554535937) ([live](https://twitter.com/counterchekist/status/1341839665473540096)): Sir, this is Twitter...  People air their grievances 24/7 without mercy or rational contemplation. https://twitter.com/JerrySeinfeld/status/1341820840149733377
* [11 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201111020614/https://twitter.com/counterchekist/status/1326345351276605442): We didn‚Äôt need to become Nazi Germany to defeat them. In fact we stood totally opposed.  If you want to fight with the gutter snipes in the gutter; that‚Äôs fine. But you‚Äôre giving them a massive advantage.  Fight on our turf, and our circumstances... not the other way around.
* [10 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201111020614/https://twitter.com/counterchekist/status/1326345351276605442) ([live](https://twitter.com/counterchekist/status/1326289079835611136)): You don‚Äôt save norms by destroying them.   If you‚Äôre going to stand for everything you once opposed ‚Äî incivility, viciousness, anti-Democratic/Constitutional behavior ‚Äî then you‚Äôve stood for nothing at all.   Don‚Äôt be like them. Beat them.

You are in control of you actions. Don‚Äôt pawn it off on being something you cannot control. You control every aspect of your behavior here.  I refuse to let the enemy win. Do you?
* [20 October 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201020035816/https://twitter.com/counterchekist/status/1318401041650548737) ([live](https://twitter.com/counterchekist/status/1318396511408054272)): So they‚Äòve defeated you too, then?   Instead of focusing on the enemy, you‚Äôve turned your furry towards settling scores on your own side‚Äî an outcome our adversary designed and hoped for, I might add.  I‚Äôm not going to let them beat me. You shouldn‚Äôt either.
* [20 October 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201020035816/https://twitter.com/counterchekist/status/1318401041650548737) ([live](https://twitter.com/counterchekist/status/1318392408107851777)): Don‚Äôt f‚Äîking drag me into this sh*t. If you want to believe Microchip‚Äôs preemptive narrative on that situation, be my guest. But leave me out of it. I don‚Äôt have time for these high school bickering/nonsense games here.  This goes for all involved: Grow up or stay off my feed.

There are 0 facts to sustain this piece‚Äôs conclusions.   If tRUmp were to rewrite American history in the other direction - sans evidence - would you accept it?   You‚Äôre spinning.

Maybe you should ask the propagandist why she fed you falsehoods, then waited until today to admit it.. at ‚ÄúTHIS moment.‚Äù
* [27 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200727210322/https://twitter.com/counterchekist/status/1287855998284242944): 1619‚Äôs author just said her work is not historically based.  The real history of American slavery is bad enough without people rewriting history to suit an agenda. There‚Äôs a word for people who do that: propagandists.   Hence the equivocation to Walter Duranty...
* [27 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200727213827/https://twitter.com/counterchekist/status/1287864874098290689) ([live](https://twitter.com/counterchekist/status/1287854224148226049)): So that makes 1619 Project historically accurate despite the author saying otherwise?   Right.   Tom Cotton is a f‚Äîking moron who loves politicizing identity issues. NYT/Hannah-Jones should‚Äôve made life easier by directly donating money to advancing his career and ideology.
* [27 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200727210322/https://twitter.com/counterchekist/status/1287855998284242944) ([live](https://twitter.com/counterchekist/status/1287850347264987138)): The ‚ÄúDuranty‚Äú Times ( @nytimes ) has published yet another Pulitzer prize winning propagandist specializing in fact-free, ahistorical nonsense.  Has Hannah-Jones ever answered for her & husband‚Äôs  shady finances + connections relating to 1619 Project?  ... Don‚Äôt hold your breath. pic.twitter.com/Xdya1xlGIv

A company spun off from MIT is currently working on an MSR that uses existing stocks of nuclear waste to power it. MSRs also have a lower risk for meltdowns than the widely used LWRs.
* [21 February 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200221234641/https://twitter.com/counterchekist/status/1231001648320913409): Man, if I was a POTUS candidate and IC told me, even in secret, that foreign elements were aiding my campaign; my new campaign message would‚Äôve be telling said foreign elements to f‚Äîk off. Can be done without divulging classified information.  I sure as hell wouldn‚Äôt ignore it.

This isn‚Äôt to discourage anyone from using it, but let‚Äôs be real here.

It‚Äòs like watching 2016 happen all over again. And his diehard supporters could care less.   At this point, they‚Äôre no better than the MAGA cult and should be treated with the same disdain.

Keeping this ship on an even keel still necessitates ignoring momentary popular opinion despite popular opinion.   My point exactly.

They like Cathedral sightseeing. Clearly that‚Äôs the reason.  Next up: Huawei fires a spy for spying to show they‚Äôre clearly not employing spies.

They‚Äôre also highly trained in unconventional warfare, intellgience collection, and small unit tactics &amp; strategy vs larger force. Same goes for GROM.
