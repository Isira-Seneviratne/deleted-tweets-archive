I don't want to go to jail for saying we could boo pity a bingbang and pop when I could just be cryptic with gaming. You already know my intent is world domination.

It could be a currency to us, and a commodity to sell. It would take more thought than just that, but it is a thing that is designed for group use. We could literally have bloc coins -- billions of them possibly.  @161_AFA

It's just a way to get noobs into crypto. Nft can mean a lot more though. I think when cs:go gambling gets old nft might really take off. They are getting rich gambling game skins. Mcskillet was 18 when he got so rich he went crazy killed self

Pam and Zoya find free nft's that end up being worth money all the time. There are drops and sweepstakes to win nft's. Sometimes companies give them away. Idk the company, but remember a giveaway of 1800 free nft's...

I can't medically possibly have sex for another 11 months, so I can't rape you, and I promise not to kill any women. Emphasis on any.
