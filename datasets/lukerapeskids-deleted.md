Whatever you do do not make any memes and @ my professional account at  @lukeobrien  with offensive memes like this, I might get fired. Why can’t you accept me for the pedo nigger lover that I am?  #ATL  pic.twitter.com/D2ewL8vuLz

I write for the  @HuffPost  but in my off time I am a pedophile rapist. I just wanted to come clean about it so I chose  @jack  Dorsey’s website to confess to the world about my overwrought libidinous life choices. pic.twitter.com/g9Qld3uEXs
