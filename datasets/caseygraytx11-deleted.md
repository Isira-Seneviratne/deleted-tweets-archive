Especially guys like him. Being a bad LEO is a choice, he not only chose it but came here to defend it. There simply isn‚Äôt room to allow these clowns anymore space to grow.

The Sheriff decided he did not like unauthorized Constitutionally armed citizens. He arrested them. Confiscated guns. All charges dropped and they were released. They are now suing. I agree they should sue

* [23 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210823174341/https://twitter.com/caseygraytx11/status/1429646637840875529): You are just a dumbass if that is your interpretation.   Nobody is signaling for any ‚Äúsecret.‚Äù It is very clear.   Do your job right and praised for it.  Use your job to violate Constitutional rights and we won‚Äôt stand for it.   Don‚Äôt be stupid.
