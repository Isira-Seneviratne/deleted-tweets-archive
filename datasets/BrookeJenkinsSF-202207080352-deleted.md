Chesa Boudin has never acknowledged the part he and his office played in this nightmare. He won’t hold himself accountable, let alone anyone else. pic.twitter.com/sYyRmPRDal <!--1522613566808870912-->

It is a prime example of how Chesa Boudin’s policies and decision making has had disastrous impacts on innocent lives. Don Du Bain explains what actually happened in that case very well in this video. pic.twitter.com/cU7yxrFHPI <!--1522612825444675585-->

We aren’t Republicans or disgruntled employees.  We are people who know how this job can be done done effectively and competently. https://twitter.com/safersfnoboudin/status/1521871926452318208 <!--1521898515063967745-->

His poor decisions and judgment have real impact on San Francisco.  Thank you Shirin for speaking up! https://twitter.com/safersfnoboudin/status/1516071036285988866 <!--1516083044373123073-->

Yet I was reminded of a hostile witness in court by CB’s intense defensiveness, repeated interrupting, and refusal to answer questions directly. <!--1514857373826895875-->

Is this how he deals with those who possess and use guns?  Chesa Boudin’s rhetoric is his main tool to win over voters, but that depends upon voters not knowing the facts/truth.  So here it is! <!--1513755990159626242-->

This defendant spent 9 days in jail on this case before this happened. <!--1513755298883801089-->

Today, I will begin sharing specific case examples to prove how he is refusing to hold offenders accountable and lying to voters. Let’s start with guns… <!--1513753468019695617-->

We aren’t imaging it, it’s not just a feeling. It’s a reality. We don’t have security to protect us like he does. We are at risk 24/7. <!--1499787710688493570-->
