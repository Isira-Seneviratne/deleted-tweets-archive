They spied on Donald Trump as President.  It was all even worse than we thought. https://twitter.com/techno_fog/status/1492520154156126211
* [ 6 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211006170132/https://twitter.com/MarkMeadows/status/1445796232190779395): Reminder that there are still (at least) hundreds of Americans trapped in Afghanistan—and the only one apparently making any apparent effort or progress to rescue them are private citizens

And how we may have 25,000... in one month.  This would be absolutely catastrophic for our border security. https://twitter.com/mhackman/status/1375600904653713409
