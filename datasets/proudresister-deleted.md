Democratic socialism is the vaccine to save capitalism from eating itself, our earth, and our people.  Tragically, the people have been conditioned to be afraid of the cure.

But bad at providing economic relief to its people and medical supplies to hospitals during a pandemic.  IT MEANS IT’S TIME FOR A BETTER GOVERNMENT  Support ➡️  #DownBallotProgressives

Also, I saw on your profile that you are a nurse. I cannot thank you enough for your sacrifice and service to our country.  You are a hero. ❤️

Trump is no King!
* [13 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200413205009/https://twitter.com/ProudResister/status/1249800725858672640): I can speak for myself, thanks.  I did used to advocate “Vote Blue No Matter Who.”  I’ve realized slogans like that give a false sense of hope and security. They reduce policy and progress to the background.  For Democrats to WIN BIG we gotta earn votes, not act entitled to them.

One party is fascist and the other party is content to just say how bad the fascist party is—but they refuse to fight for any real meaningful change. And don’t get me started on the voters. They enabled all of this by settling for the status quo.
* [11 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200411235556/https://twitter.com/ProudResister/status/1249123734730018818): You don’t win the hearts and minds of millions of Americans who are fighting for a better world & a better future by telling them to sit down & shut up.  The corporate wing of the Democratic party has taken the left for granted for far too long. Those days are over.   #EarnOurVote
* [11 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200411233520/https://twitter.com/ProudResister/status/1249118236270002177): Michael Moore: “ @JoeBiden  cannot defeat Trump without young people.   @MMFlint  is right.  Biden won’t beat Trump if he takes the youth or the left for granted. Yet rather than digest this truth & push Biden on policy, centrists are attacking him.  Y’all learned NOTHING from 2016.
* [11 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200411181227/https://twitter.com/ProudResister/status/1249037174667763712): You are misreading my tweet.

And we have a Centrist Party that is reluctant to fight for real change.  If we don’t move left America will keep being dragged even further right.
* [11 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200411171704/https://twitter.com/ProudResister/status/1249022688732966913): If you think we are going to beat Trump by focusing more on appealing to the 10 Never Trump Republicans that you see on CNN and MSNBC than the millions of passionate and bighearted leftists who are fighting for real change then you watch way too much corporate media.
* [11 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200411171049/https://twitter.com/ProudResister/status/1249020212118089728): All you do is troll and shame. Unfollowed.

But compromising our values means corporate greed will continue to destroy our planet and our democracy. It’s time for moderates to compromise too.
* [11 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200411072423/https://twitter.com/ProudResister/status/1248873975725174784): Because people aren’t demanding more than slogans and confetti. https://twitter.com/breenewsome/status/1248643771476180993

But when millions of Americans are struggling you do not throw opulence in their face with Great Gatsby style fundraisers.  You lay down good policy at their feet like  #MedicareForAll . https://twitter.com/thisizjoey/status/1248679166448295936

Capitalism was already failing us before this pandemic. Now it’s failing even more. The storm is coming. https://twitter.com/dkthomp/status/1248362072750071809

So maybe lay off the grassroots activists and organizations who are fighting for the progressive policies that we need.
* [ 9 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200409054524/https://twitter.com/ProudResister/status/1248124404870959105): Are you serious? What I just proposed is meeting in the middle.
* [ 9 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200409053723/https://twitter.com/ProudResister/status/1248122747042951168): Great keeping then keep pushing Biden and don’t shame Bernie supporters.
* [ 9 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200409053723/https://twitter.com/ProudResister/status/1248122747042951168) ([live](https://twitter.com/ProudResister/status/1248119929636663296)): I don’t know if it’s fear or entitlement or both. But sit down, shut up, and vote for Biden is a bad voter outreach strategy.  So if you want to actually help Biden beat Trump then push him left on economic, healthcare & climate policy.  That’s what the left cares about.  POLICY.

Because nothing will fundamentally change in this country as long as we have two parties that represent the 1%.
* [ 8 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200408040217/https://twitter.com/ProudResister/status/1247735960374140934): Good fucking grief. The way the corporate media and centrists talk you’d think Biden would have a much bigger lead. When did Democrats start hating democracy so much? Every voter should be allowed to cast their vote in a primary. pic.twitter.com/TYhH3A9YcQ

During the great depression we elected FDR. During the pandemic we could elect Bernie and we will need his bold policies to recover from this crisis.  #BernieIsOurHope

I’ve NEVER used a snake emoji.  But I’ve been called “young & dumb.”  A “fraud”, a “grifter”, and “divisive.”  For supporting  @BernieSanders  & wanting everybody in this country to have health care during a pandemic.

After the great depression we got FDR. After the pandemic we could have Bernie. Never mind, that’s crazy talk. This plutocracy is working out so well for 621 billionaires. Let’s just keep voting against our best interests.

This post is not even about Bernie. The fight for progress will continue no matter what happens in this election.

But Democrats embrace of it effectively left us with two corporate controlled parties in the United States. Is a corporate Democrat better than a Republican? Yes. Is a progressive Democrat the best option? Always.

She has given progressive activists like myself and  @peterdaou  opportunities on her show to discuss Bernie’s campaign. She was also very supportive of Warren.
* [ 4 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200405201640/https://twitter.com/ProudResister/status/1246519427983536128) ([live](https://twitter.com/ProudResister/status/1246472899382280192)): I’ve been yelled at by so many centrist Democrats for simply having the audacity to advocate for everybody in this country to have healthcare, a living wage, and a habitable planet that I’m now immune to their fear-mongering. I know what and who I’m fighting for and I won’t stop.

Biden can’t win without the left. His campaign needs to do the work, reach out, and build the winning coalition. That’s how democracy works. This strategy that you can just blame, scapegoat & fear monger to turn out progressive voters is a losing one.

Is the candidate exciting voters? Do they have a compelling message? Are they building a grassroots movement? Those things matter. Enthusiasm and energy on the ground matters because it translates into ACTUAL VOTES on election day.

Less fanaticism would do Sanders supporters good.

We need progressive change in America, but that change will not happen by name-calling or alienating people. It will only happen by bringing more people in.

No. Is he exciting the base? No. Is he winning the debates? No. Is he building the kind of movement that we need to beat Trump? No. Biden is leading in the polls because Democrats are afraid and have fallen for the myth of “electability.”

There is nothing progressive about a movement that harasses, bullies, and mocks people.  Your supporters have gone too far.

Bernie Sanders doesn’t believe that a woman can beat Donald Trump.  I CALL BULLSHIT.  I understand that people are afraid, but if we make this election about fear then Trump wins. Fear is his weapon. Hope is ours. And no candidate gives me more hope than  @ewarren .

Elizabeth Warren is proving that there is another way: We can be bold and progressive and still unite our party and the country.  #Warren2020  🗽

We need to unite and pull in all parts of the Democratic coalition.”  Warren is bold, progressive, and a UNITER.

Pete has a bright future, but he is deeply under-qualified for this moment.

Also, the last 3 times Democrats lost the White House it was with a centrist. So while you think Biden’s the “safe” choice recent history shows us he will lose.  We need Warren.

Neoliberalism and the massive transfer of wealth from the middle class to the billionaire class over the past 50 years has left us no choice, but to push for real change.

Markets without rules is about the rich take it all. That’s what’s gone wrong in America.”
