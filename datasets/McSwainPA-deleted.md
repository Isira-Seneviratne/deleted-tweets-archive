By kneeling, these athletes promote lies about our country on the world stage and disgrace themselves. America is the fairest, most non-racist and tolerant country in the history of the world. https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/in-the-know/564103-us-womens-soccer-team-kneels-ahead-of-olympic-match-after

Wolf colluded w/teachers unions to keep our schools shut despite the best science saying a return would be best for our kids.  PA’s next Gov needs to prioritize take education — not powerful unions. Our kids need it. https://broadandliberty.com/2021/05/11/teachers-unions-influenced-wolf-admin-guidance-that-prolonged-school-closures/

They only reason they aren't is because of the shameful stance of the teachers union. https://whyy.org/articles/in-person-classes-old-buildings-almost-no-covid-are-philly-catholic-schools-a-blueprint/
