* [ 5 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210105002022/https://twitter.com/SenKevinCramer/status/1346250069096460294): Democratic members made objections in 2016 and kept their efforts going, promulgating a fruitless $40 million Special Counsel investigation to try to delegitimize President Trump and ultimately impeaching him simply because they lost the election.
* [ 5 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210105002022/https://twitter.com/SenKevinCramer/status/1346250069096460294): While I'm not pleased with the outcome of the election, objecting to the Electoral College votes is not an appropriate or effective way to change the results.  Though objecting is not unprecedented.

I advocated for his agenda in Congress every step of the way.  I raised over $200,000 to assist his legal efforts.

One would have a hard time finding a more fervent, consistent, longstanding supporter of this President than I've since he became a candidate.

I've received overwhelming outreach from my constituents urging me to object and carefully weighed the arguments being made.  I hear them, and understand their perspective, but this is first and foremost a matter of conscience.
* [ 5 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210105001713/https://twitter.com/SenKevinCramer/status/1346249248128593922) ([live](https://twitter.com/SenKevinCramer/status/1346249244940886016)): I don't have the authority to overturn the will of other states on behalf of ND, nor do other members have the ability to overturn the will of my state.  The only viable option for the President to obtain the remedy he seeks is through the federal judiciary.

The opposite is also true.

I share the concerns of those who will object, but the Founders didn't design a system where the legislative branch could reject a state’s certified choice for President in favor of their own.

We need to get answers while taking appropriate steps to ensure states run their elections in a trustworthy fashion, giving the American people confidence in our elections.

* [ 5 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210105001713/https://twitter.com/SenKevinCramer/status/1346249248128593922) ([live](https://twitter.com/SenKevinCramer/status/1346249239689650188)): I share the concerns of my colleagues and the countless North Dakotans who have reached out about the election.  Last year Democrats tried to use COVID-19 to implement questionable election procedures like universal vote-by-mail, ballot harvesting, and ballot curing.

I hope the House passes it quickly.

The House gave us six days to consider a three-year reauthorization with no time to debate alternative approaches.  Senate Republicans are in the majority. We don’t have to accept mediocrity. https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/1239669847904182276

As he has at every step, President  @realDonaldTrump  demonstrated the extraordinary leadership our country needs, striking the right balance of bold and decisive action with diplomacy and collaboration. https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1238570595710836738

I pledge to keep working with them to ensure the guidance they issue leads to meaningful, structural change.

North Dakota landowners deserve the right to appeal assertions of wrongdoing and be provided safe harbor while the administrative process proceeds. https://www.grandforksherald.com/news/4990323-U.S.-Fish-and-Wildlife-Service-order-aims-to-provide-North-Dakota-landowners-with-clarity-on-wetland-easements

I’ll also fight to ensure the needs of our military leaders are heard, properly addressed, and adequately funded.

The cuts proposed today would save little but inflict severe pain in American agriculture.

The Admin’s 2021 Budget contains several provisions I do not agree with.  This includes cuts to our military's intelligence gathering resources for which protect our troops & global interests. https://twitter.com/saraecook/status/1226924148980699137

At the same time, we should get this done quickly so we can move on to other important priorities.

Look at the stock market, at the economy.  We see record low unemployment numbers for every demographic and growing investor confidence thanks to trade deals secured by  @POTUS .  Everyone else has already dismissed this. pic.twitter.com/b7z47Vj1Zi

We talked about the importance of a strong partnership between our two nations.  I also invited him to North Dakota to give our agricultural & business leaders a chance to show India what we are capable of producing. pic.twitter.com/YtrgtRLFzl

After the release of the egregious 2015 WOTUS rule- which  @POTUS  rightfully repealed- North Dakotans did what we often do: step up and take a lead role in fixing it.

Grateful for the opportunity to discuss redefining WOTUS with  @EPAAWheeler  & to help put NDans in a position to continue leading on this. https://twitter.com/epaawheeler/status/1181313632686100480
