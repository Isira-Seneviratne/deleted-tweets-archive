But the book is a treatise on arrogance. Each character from Governor Sou, Inmate 16180339 to the narrator is very confident. This is a clue.  See: Book II (and III). pic.twitter.com/YkbmH8LHOB

He’s a character as is explained in the first 20 pages (he’s Ai; or PBSI as he prefers). I’m half pragmatic and half idealistic. And frankly I’m full of shit.   But, unlike most people (especially on Twitter), I KNOW I’m a hypocrite. Savvy? pic.twitter.com/s92vxPlzOu
