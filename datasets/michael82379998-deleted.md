Less than 2% of the population changed the long-established culture of our land so that a minuscule number of Jewish shop keepers could work on Sunday.  That's kinda poisonous.

Just more unnecessary White division.  I was proud to stand with all ages in C'ville.  We all had something in common we were fighting for.

The state said already had the rights of the people of their states codified into their state constitutions.

Not the states. The states already had constitutions in place that Protected Their citizens. If they wanted any more protections they would have changed their own state constitutions.

The state submitted the recommendations to protect their States from the newly-formed federal government. The states had their own constitutions to protect their people.

He was afraid it was going to remove some of the newly gained powers of the central government.  The first 10 amendments came from a watered down lists of 212 recommendations by the states to amend the new constitution.

It never had any influence on what the states decided until the federal government seized more power by coming up with the idea of the incorporation Doctrine.

It is up to the people of each of the states to decide what kind of government they want. It's none of your business or my business what states in other parts of the Union want to do.

Blue States and blue epicenters are being devastated while we in the south are having a relative good time during all this. Sounds like God's judgement to me.

Do you have any idea how this was all supposed to be set up? Every state has the equivalent of the BOR in its constitution.

We don't need busybodies in other states telling us what's good for our state.  We especially don't need our servants in the fed Gov pretending to be our masters.

You just made it sound like it was cold, hard law of the land making state constitutions irrelevant and making the states nothing more than administrative provinces of Washington, DC.
