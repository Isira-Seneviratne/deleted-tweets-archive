They understand that the spending and increased taxes proposed (and make no mistake - your taxes will go up) will make life in rural America worse, not better. Don't worry Farm Bureau, I hear you loud and clear.

Did you know that Minnesota has the largest number of independent turkey farmers and the largest production of turkey in the United States? And that they’re primarily grown in the 7th district? pic.twitter.com/p6GcSk2SYT

They are one of just a handful of distilleries that actually harvest their own grain, so their products go straight from field to glass! pic.twitter.com/i3ux1w1RBf

When will President Biden act on behalf of these American citizens? pic.twitter.com/QUcizCiO33

With a workforce of 1,400+ in Roseau alone, they are a major asset to the region and state.  @PolarisORV  pic.twitter.com/BbM0t4tUm2

I just left a meeting at the historic Carnegie Library, which was a gift from philanthropist Andrew Carnegie more than a century ago and was recently restored by the community. I enjoyed seeing this piece of local history!  #mn07  pic.twitter.com/egdPQyb4el

For four decades, the bipartisan Hyde Amendment has prevented our tax dollars from funding abortions. Americans should NOT be forced to subsidize abortions!  #SaveHyde   https://rsc-banks.house.gov/news/press-releases/republican-study-committee-demands-congressional-leaders-save-hyde-amendment  pic.twitter.com/AaWhqZcWzA
