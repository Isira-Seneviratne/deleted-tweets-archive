* [26 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210926191917/https://twitter.com/FergusonRex12/status/1442207061366829056): The LGBTQLMNOP+ community justifies everyone’s hatred of them.

* [19 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210920215257/https://twitter.com/FergusonRex12/status/1439683067501633558): It’s a man’s duty to protect women, even from themselves. The issue here is that women have been taught to think that they don’t need men.
* [19 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210920214732/https://twitter.com/FergusonRex12/status/1439681104823291906): This is physically painful to watch.
* [19 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210920211827/https://twitter.com/FergusonRex12/status/1439670101519712256): Too bad the protesters didn’t have guns. Looks like the Aussies are ready to use them.
* [19 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210920211404/https://twitter.com/FergusonRex12/status/1439668664341438466): The US government. White replacement is in full swing and they’re not even hiding it anymore.
* [19 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210920211308/https://twitter.com/FergusonRex12/status/1439668316092571648): The right is attracted to law and order. The right is beginning to no longer support law enforcement because they’re finally realizing that the vast majority of police, especially the feds, only care about pleasing the ruling class.
* [19 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210920210907/https://twitter.com/FergusonRex12/status/1439666886564671488): What a legend. Fuck the system pigs. https://twitter.com/elijahschaffer/status/1439413241227132929

* [18 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210920030710/https://twitter.com/FergusonRex12/status/1439311026260832260): White pride, worldwide. https://twitter.com/davereaboi/status/1439231859116974086

* [17 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210918170734/https://twitter.com/FergusonRex12/status/1438882573262852103): You look like your mom just kicked you out  because she caught you watching hentai on the family desktop.
* [17 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210918170534/https://twitter.com/FergusonRex12/status/1438882183209369608): My thoughts exactly.

* [29 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210829191241/https://twitter.com/FergusonRex12/status/1432056619311919115): America is not the world’s sanctuary. This nation’s founders were persecuted in their homeland. Yet they did not seek refuge in foreign nations. Rather, they fought and died to secure and build a nation so great that today everyone in the world wants to come here.
* [29 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210829190314/https://twitter.com/FergusonRex12/status/1432052308213256196): Rap is the music of a garbage culture.
* [29 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210829191550/https://twitter.com/FergusonRex12/status/1432052157105065988): There’s nothing racist about not wanting unskilled, low IQ workers flooding into your country. My ancestors founded and built this country to hand down to their posterity. Not to watch their posterity hand it over to the third world.  #closedborders
* [29 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210829184259/https://twitter.com/FergusonRex12/status/1432048569104490496): It’s crazy how the government just lies about the fact that they’re letting illegal immigrants into the country and giving them court dates that are as far as three years out. In the meantime, these people will disappear into the interior, never to be heard from again.
* [29 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210829185310/https://twitter.com/FergusonRex12/status/1432047687596011521): People like you prove that humans are mostly sheep. COVID is a glorified cold, the vaccine is ineffective and masks do nothing to slow the spread. If you’re so worried about COVID then you should be concerned about the thousands of illegal immigrants flooding across the border.
* [28 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210828201733/https://twitter.com/FergusonRex12/status/1431710345102385154): My point is that, in a real deadly pandemic you wouldn’t need the MSM and the government constantly reminding you that there’s a deadly pandemic. It would be obvious because of the fact that half of your friends and family have died.
* [28 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210828202734/https://twitter.com/FergusonRex12/status/1431709276079214594): Masks weren’t mandated on a federal or even state level during the Spanish flu, but on a local level. And there are conflicting studies on how effective they were at reducing the spread of the Spanish Flu.
* [28 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210828201023/https://twitter.com/FergusonRex12/status/1431708453160980481): If the vaccine is so effective then why are roughly 30% of the people hospitalized with COVID fully vaccinated? Either the infection and hospitalization rates are inflated or the vaccine is less effective than they say it is. Most likely a little of both.
* [28 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210828201949/https://twitter.com/FergusonRex12/status/1431708012071174146): The government is using this virus as an excuse to take away our rights. If they believed in what they say then they wouldn’t be allowing tens of thousands of potentially infected immigrants to flow across the southern border.
* [28 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210828204712/https://twitter.com/FergusonRex12/status/1431705538090340352): The COVID death count is inflated. If this virus was as deadly as they say it is then people we know IRL would be dropping dead left and right. It’s just not happening. During the Spanish Flu pandemic you didn’t need the government to tell you their was a pandemic.
* [28 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210828200827/https://twitter.com/FergusonRex12/status/1431702226330808321): You mean the vaccine that neither prevents you from spreading the virus or contracting it?
* [28 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210828195839/https://twitter.com/FergusonRex12/status/1431701692555280390): Instead of locking people in their homes and compromising their immune system, we should’ve been encouraging people to exercise, eat right, take vitamins and so forth. For some reason, maintaining a healthy weight and taking supplements was never a part of the discussion.
* [28 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210828200835/https://twitter.com/FergusonRex12/status/1431700924104278018): You mean the morbidly obese and generally unhealthy? Those people are nearly just as likely to die from the flu. I’ve had influenza infections in the past that were far worse than this virus.
* [28 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210828201201/https://twitter.com/FergusonRex12/status/1431700314193686532): Nearly all of us will end up catching COVID. It’s just a matter of when. A mask does nothing to reduce the spread. The vaccine apparently doesn’t do a damn thing. The best thing we can do is catch COVID and build a natural immunity.
* [28 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210828195106/https://twitter.com/FergusonRex12/status/1431699252313350149): I’ve had COVID. It’s literally a glorified cold.
* [28 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210828184319/https://twitter.com/FergusonRex12/status/1431680485227307014): If you get it, DM to me.
* [28 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210828185133/https://twitter.com/FergusonRex12/status/1431679436873617408): I don’t give a shit about Afghanistan, only the Americans that are trapped in that shithole.
* [28 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210828185455/https://twitter.com/FergusonRex12/status/1431679157814001664): Politicians won’t save us.
* [28 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210828183224/https://twitter.com/FergusonRex12/status/1431675184080031746): “I made out with a woman when I was drunk at a college party so that makes me bisexual, vote for me!” - Kate Brown She’s the worst and I’m not complying with ANY mask mandate.
* [26 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210826194144/https://twitter.com/FergusonRex12/status/1430966321445957635): Him first.

* [23 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210824050150/https://twitter.com/FergusonRex12/status/1429841863171739656): What a lying fehg.
* [23 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210824045904/https://twitter.com/FergusonRex12/status/1429840158627557386): Been stuck at home with covid for the last week and I've gotta say, this ain't shit.
* [23 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210824044641/https://twitter.com/FergusonRex12/status/1429839477254488064): Proud of your Boy to all the Proud Boys who kicked antifa's ass in Portland yesterday. UHURU!

* [22 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210823071614/https://twitter.com/FergusonRex12/status/1429505173710196738): There is a common denominator when it comes to violent crime.
* [22 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210823045428/https://twitter.com/FergusonRex12/status/1429504364771565569): Oh, tough guy over here.

* [19 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210819193506/https://twitter.com/FergusonRex12/status/1428409861566386176): The US allied Afghans are pedophiles. Google "Bacha Bazi" and you'll understand why we shouldn't be allowing even a single "refugee" from Afghanistan into the US.
* [18 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210818181319/https://twitter.com/FergusonRex12/status/1428056662141587466): Terrible how the Afghan men have completely failed their women and children. As usual American men are expected to do the job of another nation’s men.
* [18 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210818183431/https://twitter.com/FergusonRex12/status/1428055979774541826): Because they’re cowards.

* [ 1 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210801192432/https://twitter.com/FergusonRex12/status/1421914689236209664): I’m sure you’re having a hard time understanding. What with your side thinking that a “peaceful protest” is when you go out and attack people and burn shit. The idea that an activist group wouldn’t abuse their numerical advantage in a confrontation must be totally alien to you.
* [ 1 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210801191857/https://twitter.com/FergusonRex12/status/1421913332353617920): If PF wanted to they could’ve put all of those guys out of commission. But they didn’t go to Philly to stomp out low IQ degenerates and go to jail. They went to Philly to have a peaceful demonstration in honor of the men who who built this nation.
* [ 1 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210801191121/https://twitter.com/FergusonRex12/status/1421911424314478596): I saw the video. The Philadelphians didn’t land a single punch or cause any injuries. PF successfully defended themselves and avoided getting any charges. I think it’s hilarious that y’all actually think that 50-100 trained men were scared of half a dozen drunken Philadelphians.
* [ 1 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210801181153/https://twitter.com/FergusonRex12/status/1421896454600216586): No, this has not occured.

Antifa and BLM show up to every event we have (so long as they outnumber us) to harass and antagonize us until we leave.

Or the 6,000 Trump votes that were attributed to Biden in Wisconsin do to a "software error"? Biden got 140,000 votes in a row in PA convenientlying after everyone went to bed? You really believe that?
