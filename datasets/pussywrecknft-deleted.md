Give them a real one, with a truly epic story, and the majority would jump. The crown is fucking heavy though -- maybe too heavy for Zoya. No? She has to accept it. All I can do is train her to be a door gunner from hell.

* [25 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211025101532/https://twitter.com/PussyWreckNft/status/1452466285170724865): I can't trust just anybody, especially in Detroit. Birmingham doesn't have a large enough economy for my kind of exploitation, but I'm about to stop working shortly.
* [25 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211025101410/https://twitter.com/PussyWreckNft/status/1452465812871073792): They have a better work ethic in Mexico. Idk what good it did them, but it is there.
* [25 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211025101305/https://twitter.com/PussyWreckNft/status/1452465462474801153): I know you will say no too. It's the Pisces in me. This country will not get what it needs. It remains cursed. You don't have to be.
* [25 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211025100704/https://twitter.com/PussyWreckNft/status/1452463450693586945): I didn't mean mainstream culture.
* [25 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211025100558/https://twitter.com/PussyWreckNft/status/1452463088586739712): You need to know what I know too. It is applicable to the overall country. Culture is different all over this land. I'm good with most of it -- from the Carolinas to Adirondacks, down south and over here too. The better you are with culture, the better the product will be.
* [25 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211025100050/https://twitter.com/PussyWreckNft/status/1452461272042127365): Detroit is awesome. The 4 of us, and Zoya, in the same city--like now --would be epic. Sacred even. Get your mind out of the gutter too. It is what it is, or it aint.
* [25 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211025093733/https://twitter.com/PussyWreckNft/status/1452453373987282944): I'm even more charming irl.
* [25 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211025093733/https://twitter.com/PussyWreckNft/status/1452453373987282944): The 3 of you together,  and whatever assorted boy and girl toys could definitely take me out if you had to.  @161_AFA   @Claudio_Report   @AlissaAzar
* [25 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211025093118/https://twitter.com/PussyWreckNft/status/1452451332414066688): We never fight each other outside, or kick a real one into the street. Once you are in you are in.
* [25 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211025093017/https://twitter.com/PussyWreckNft/status/1452451017837084673): You think your life is complicated-- just wait until you see mine. I will never leave you if we are plutonic -- fuck platonic.  @Claudio_Report
* [25 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211025091454/https://twitter.com/PussyWreckNft/status/1452447222998568962): They made almost all the asbestos for the country in Brightmoor. The Rogue River is our disgrace.
* [25 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211025091454/https://twitter.com/PussyWreckNft/status/1452447222998568962): Skill development is important too, and living rent free. Detroit has the same population as Portland, and an awesome economy for us. Nature is a 20 mile drive north, otherwise, what you will see is where the most efficient system of eugenics ever was implemented.
* [25 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211025091454/https://twitter.com/PussyWreckNft/status/1452447222998568962): I can protect you all in Michigan. It would take months to move all my shit out here. Azar will need extra protection, same as me and Zoya.
* [25 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211025091454/https://twitter.com/PussyWreckNft/status/1452447222998568962): Go back to Michigan with me.  @161_AFA   @AlissaAzar   @Claudio_Report  bring your toys too. Make them miss you for a year. Distance makes the heart grow fonder.
* [25 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211025084735/https://twitter.com/PussyWreckNft/status/1452438780879642631): But then, nature. When there is none left, we go too. Could be foolish to make a 5 year plan.  @161_AFA   @161_AFA   @AlissaAzar   @Claudio_Report
* [25 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211025084446/https://twitter.com/PussyWreckNft/status/1452437865590185984): Bloc is also a semi-underground mutual aid group, and good at it. There's just so much in Michigan going on right now. People don't go hungry in Michigan. They don't. It was famine forever in Detroit. It's a feastnow  They fucking die in Alabama. Idk fuck shit about Oregon - yet.
* [25 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211025083853/https://twitter.com/PussyWreckNft/status/1452435916966940673): Thinking of how actual indigenous tribes handle it, or even a village in Sudan. It's ugly, cheap and probably more accurate at identifying real criminals. Dig a hole, throw 'em in until they straighten up, or die, depending on crime. Ok, I'm in, with caveats.
* [25 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211025082421/https://twitter.com/PussyWreckNft/status/1452430411120852994): You have to be getting sick of the scene here by now. Nature, yeah, spot on. The fuckery,  not so much. Ijs. Is it worth saving now? Sometimes I think it'd be easier to eat a bullet.
* [25 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211025082421/https://twitter.com/PussyWreckNft/status/1452430411120852994): Idk though, you know. I could hold this lot for 5 years, do nothing, and sell it for 100% profit I'm sure. Or, borrow against it for 5 times its actual value, default and go to Mexico.
* [25 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211025082421/https://twitter.com/PussyWreckNft/status/1452430411120852994): It's like $586 a week for the studio I'm in for 2 weeks -- downtown.
* [25 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211025082421/https://twitter.com/PussyWreckNft/status/1452430411120852994): But you definitely got enough retards to make a retard pie fucking with you. I'd imagine it would be easy for a shit lawyer.
* [25 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211025082421/https://twitter.com/PussyWreckNft/status/1452430411120852994): You got your lawsuits eventually. Not very anarchistic, but all is fair in war, and the only people that owe me money and won't pay are repubs in my own family. Mad cause I don't make the non repubs pay me back I guess.
* [25 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211025082421/https://twitter.com/PussyWreckNft/status/1452430411120852994): I wouldn't suggest hotel work. It's not easy or fun.
* [25 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211025082421/https://twitter.com/PussyWreckNft/status/1452430411120852994): No shame in it really. Considering what you gave up for this crew; it's admirable. Porn is nothing to get into for bread now.
* [25 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211025082421/https://twitter.com/PussyWreckNft/status/1452430411120852994): @Claudio_Report  things I've learned: bloc and antifa are 2 different things. Bloc is cool kids in black cars and clothes -- sometimes showing for a DA. Antifa is Claudio, fucked up in the hotel somewhere.
* [24 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211024183218/https://twitter.com/PussyWreckNft/status/1452337286029320194): Pink is a gangster color in Detroit. It can get you into all kinds of hell with the neighbors.  https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=AsfVZqZhtUQ&feature=share
* [24 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211024181339/https://twitter.com/PussyWreckNft/status/1452333174013444105): The little bank security I guess -- by the jail.
* [24 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211024181243/https://twitter.com/PussyWreckNft/status/1452332949475631106): Security came by. I said don't kill him Jake when dude walked by. Even security ain't got the nuts to fuck with me.
* [24 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211024181128/https://twitter.com/PussyWreckNft/status/1452332698756919306): He was reading. I wanted to ask him if he read any of my shit. I'm sure he has, but he'd probably be insulting. I don't usually second guess the universe, and he did peddle off after he saw Jake go after the punk.
* [24 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211024180802/https://twitter.com/PussyWreckNft/status/1452331996168982532): He was dressed to the 9's. I was in the 6's and not in colors. My black flag is on the house. Black is a thing here. Birmingham and Detroit put colors down in 92.
* [24 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211024180617/https://twitter.com/PussyWreckNft/status/1452331595969540112): Idkm. Only person I asked about I asked in public. Maybe somebody asked about him and me too. I'm sure. The old anarchist with the tricycle. By the time I decided to go talk to him he peddled off, and Jake went after some punk. I just never saw anything like that. I'm from Alabam
