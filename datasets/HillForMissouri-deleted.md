* [ 9 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210109144408/https://twitter.com/HillForMissouri/status/1347916748125827073): @JackSuntrup , you wrote, “In Washington, rioters wielding pro-Trump banners, some with firearms, quickly overwhelmed U.S. Capitol Police as they broke their way into the Senate chamber and offices.” This is the first I’ve heard of people having guns in the capitol. I hope not.

But you wouldn’t know that because your focus is on ruining people rather than winning people. People are sick of your keyboard courage. Adults win on policy, not trying to tattle on the opposition with fake news.

I attended a peaceful rally for  @realDonaldTrump  at the White House then left before he finished. Later to find out instigators broke into the capitol, of which I have condemned their crimes. Amateur journalism. Make the correction.

Inflation from increasing the money supply. Every time we get “stimulus” it gets worse. Teachers and other fixed wage earners pay the most.

Everyone is struggling right now. For a teacher to be complaining for a pay raise, especially while many are being paid while not working, is a slap in the face of the public who pays their salary. Teachers are public servants.
* [ 3 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210103035333/https://twitter.com/HillForMissouri/status/1345578949108260864): Get a different job. No one owes you anything.

We can’t even take care of children in the  #moleg . How can we advocate for anything until we all call for  @ImWithWiley  to resign for his sexual relationship with an intern?  @crystal_quade  this will not go away. Do the right thing.

Using ones position to have sex with a presumed teenager is conduct unbecoming of a public figure. Call it what you want, I and  @crystal_quade  call it sexual abuse.
* [17 December 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20210108023341/https://twitter.com/HillForMissouri/status/1339364141010722816): If that’s the case, it is bad. But not calling for the resignation of a sitting member who had a sexual relationship with an intern is pathetic. We can all get behind condemning sexual abuse.

I condemn all sex abuse found to be factual by an investigation. The fact that  @crystal_quade  cannot is disturbing.  #moleg
