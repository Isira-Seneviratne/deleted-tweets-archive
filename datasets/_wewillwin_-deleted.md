After support is just as important as initial install, because you will eventually need some kind of service more than likely. We had a seam fail after 8 years and some Mica lift needed ground down. Fixed for free.
* [30 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200830050134/https://twitter.com/_WeWillWin_/status/1299935120955244545): Don't spend big if you're not staying in the home.

Biases serve a legitimate purpose, but taken to the extreme they can obscure the truth and put you on the wrong path. You end up no better than what you think you hate the most.
* [29 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200829224912/https://twitter.com/_WeWillWin_/status/1299841510142365697): You're welcome. He'll probably block me again because he doesn't trust the police, but I still did him a solid. üëä

I've dealt with a lot of dumb defense lawyers (prosecutors too) Do I assume you're dumb? No. You likely deal more frequently with aggressive officers who want to win at any cost. Are we all like that? No.  You're in a bubble of your own construction.
* [29 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200829221207/https://twitter.com/_WeWillWin_/status/1299832176540819468): That's not been my experience at a top 100 department (size). Were you a cop before you became an attorney? We get some of those, but they're the ones most likely to abandon the street from burnout. I guess they drive policy at that point, but they don't have street support.
* [29 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200829215123/https://twitter.com/_WeWillWin_/status/1299826951176237067): That's unfortunate.

Expecting everything to change overnight without some enormous watershed moment is folly.
* [29 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200829204031/https://twitter.com/_WeWillWin_/status/1299809011378851840): I'm a cop. That was fucking idiotic.

* [29 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200829201718/https://twitter.com/_WeWillWin_/status/1299803194328076288): Currently drinking an Old Fashioned made with the cheapy Schnucks 4 year old distilled at Heaven Hill. Not bad.

There was a LOT of pre-seeding of the color aspect. My guess? This was happening no matter who ended up in power, but the "right" person would have facilitated it and feigned ignorance. (Hilldawg)
