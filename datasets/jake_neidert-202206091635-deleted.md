Because of my scholarships i couldn‚Äôt find a community college for less money than i pay for Baylor. I couldn‚Äôt have gone if i hadn‚Äôt worked hard to get in with extreme scholarships

And guess what, I‚Äôve worked for 7.25/hour and it sucked. But it‚Äôs livable if you put the time in. And putting the time in gets you a better job

I didn‚Äôt say you can live and retire off of minimum, or that it supports long term, but it sure can work if you use your money wisely and are willing to work volume

That‚Äôs a disgusting take, and no different from saying what a person wears is a factor. I can‚Äôt believe you would take such a pro rape stance tbh. Sick

If we can make it illegal and criminalize the abortion practice, then we can limit these deaths. Anyone who gets an abortion can repent, but they have to answer in this life for the child who never had one

Abortion is the murder of the victim, who is left with no life.
