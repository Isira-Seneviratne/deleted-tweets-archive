You just said out loud on twitter that a politician should be shot.
* [11 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210911012157/https://twitter.com/CountDankulaTV/status/1436500210965008386): "You should not be shot"  "I was being sarcastic"  So you think I should be shot, and you just confessed that, out here on twitter, you just said that a politician should be shot? Just want to clarify that James.
* [11 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210911012157/https://twitter.com/CountDankulaTV/status/1436500210965008386) ([live](https://twitter.com/CountDankulaTV/status/1436498614726103059)): So you said you were being sarcastic, so did you just say out loud on Twitter that a politician should be shot?

I'm just personally not getting the vaccine, I haven't told anyone not to get it.  I also have all of my own standard vaccinations and took my baby the other month to get all of hers.

I know this since I was once like you.  Then I actually tried harder instead of moaning for other peoples stuff.  You will grow out of it.
* [26 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210626231430/https://twitter.com/CountDankulaTV/status/1408926642546876427) ([live](https://twitter.com/CountDankulaTV/status/1408921779452755973)): Says the guy who thinks that everyone is going to hold hands, sing kumbaya and all unanimously reach agreement over what everyone should get lmfao.

You know, the way things work right now, in fact if you get a job you can literally go out and buy resources yourself, its really easy.  How about dont tell me what I can do with my own property and stop trying to take my shit?

I feel like willfully removing a piece of Internet history is a bit shitty, but it's his property, he can do what he likes with it. https://twitter.com/stardustsummons/status/1402006147910057984
* [ 7 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210607220016/https://twitter.com/CountDankulaTV/status/1402022580559699976): It's more the fact of when/how/where efs  managed to track it, get the keys, access the wallet etc.  This isn't an amount thing, it's more how bitcoin failed to do the thing it was supposed to be able to.
* [ 7 June 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210607220016/https://twitter.com/CountDankulaTV/status/1402022580559699976) ([live](https://twitter.com/CountDankulaTV/status/1402021011864891394)): Some market fuckery might be about to go down since the feds just seized a shitload of bitcoin.

There is already talks of vaccine passports, where if you want to use any basic service, business, or even travel, you will have to be vaccinated.  Which is force with extra steps.
* [28 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210528214139/https://twitter.com/CountDankulaTV/status/1398393999895969794) ([live](https://twitter.com/CountDankulaTV/status/1398351827888967686)): I'm suspicious of the government forcing behaviour on people yes.  Tell me, would you eat rat meat?

I'm interested to hear how your mind arrived at a point so far from the mark, I want to know if it was on purpose or you have some sort of problem.
* [28 May 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210528214139/https://twitter.com/CountDankulaTV/status/1398393999895969794) ([live](https://twitter.com/CountDankulaTV/status/1398311338514989058)): That's an interesting fan-fic, good luck with it.

Because they are shit at it, which was the point of the tweet.  I mean, if you want to be a revolutionary, at least try.
* [ 4 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210104214649/https://twitter.com/CountDankulaTV/status/1346211379007676418): That's actually the hospital my mate works in.  Even better, he actually knows you lmfao. pic.twitter.com/4lzVbVv66a

I'm glad you think that's a bad thing though, acknowledging your shitty behaviour is the first step.  Ayr? Fucking perfect brb.
* [ 4 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210104214649/https://twitter.com/CountDankulaTV/status/1346211379007676418) ([live](https://twitter.com/CountDankulaTV/status/1346207084707262464)): Cool, you are a pedo, saw you admit it yourself, I would totally post the evidence of you saying it but I'm not going to scroll through 10 months of your tweets so I guess you are just going to have to deal with it.  See how that's a bit unfair?  Which hospital?
* [ 4 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210104214649/https://twitter.com/CountDankulaTV/status/1346211379007676418) ([live](https://twitter.com/CountDankulaTV/status/1346205699722895362)): Yeah thats exactly how he got a job in a hospital, nothing to do with university or his qualifications or anything like that, he just told them he was a discord mod and got the job.  Maybe someone is lying, and given that you literally just got caught lying, it's probably you.
* [ 4 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210104214649/https://twitter.com/CountDankulaTV/status/1346211379007676418) ([live](https://twitter.com/CountDankulaTV/status/1346204735133659142)): 4 actually.  One of them is my discord mod.  So you just going to not address the fact you got caught lying?  Why do you guys always just move on as if nothing happened when you get caught lying and divert right to something else? It's just so brazen but you always do it.
* [ 4 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210104214649/https://twitter.com/CountDankulaTV/status/1346211379007676418) ([live](https://twitter.com/CountDankulaTV/status/1346203855692902400)): Nowhere in that tweet does it say any of what you just said.  Wait, are you going down the "well this is what I think you meant" path because if you are oh boy am I going to have fun with you.
* [ 2 December 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201202005422/https://twitter.com/CountDankulaTV/status/1333937289991479296): Why ask the question if you just instablock me right after you ask it? pic.twitter.com/nV2f5UhOrL

* [24 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201124010200/https://twitter.com/CountDankulaTV/status/1331040303785111555) ([live](https://twitter.com/CountDankulaTV/status/1331039828641804291)): TL:DR Don't be a cunt, cradle my balls.

Just don't try to control it.
* [24 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201124010200/https://twitter.com/CountDankulaTV/status/1331040303785111555) ([live](https://twitter.com/CountDankulaTV/status/1331039825210773509)): I mean fuck you even have filter tools, block buttons, block lists, all kinds of stuff to customize your internet experience and the information you have access to as you see fit. You pretty much have control over your entire internet experience.  YOUR experience. Not others.
* [24 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201124010200/https://twitter.com/CountDankulaTV/status/1331040303785111555) ([live](https://twitter.com/CountDankulaTV/status/1331039823394713601)): No one is forcing you to watch it, it's not being beamed to behind your eyelids, you can simply change the channel.  But when you take it further and try to get this content removed, then you are just a censorious cunt eith a god complex trying to control information.
* [24 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201124010200/https://twitter.com/CountDankulaTV/status/1331040303785111555) ([live](https://twitter.com/CountDankulaTV/status/1331039821607956481)): Because the point of the internet is it's supposed to be the wild west of information where all types of content can be available, if there is a type of content you want to see, you can see it.  And, if there is a type of content you do not want to see, you can simply close it.
* [24 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201124010200/https://twitter.com/CountDankulaTV/status/1331040303785111555) ([live](https://twitter.com/CountDankulaTV/status/1331039820005642240)): We live in an endless internet highway full of every type of content you desire, from Christian sermons from your local pastor, all the way to the WAP music video.  You have all of this information literally in your pocket, and it's beautiful.
* [24 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201124010200/https://twitter.com/CountDankulaTV/status/1331040303785111555) ([live](https://twitter.com/CountDankulaTV/status/1331039818374057987)): Belle Delphine getting her channel back is an opportunity to give everyone some useful advice.  If there is a type of content, or music, or idea or anything really, that you do not like, then simply do not watch it.  Don't try to get it banned or take it down.

Edinburgh is the Scottish California.

For example, you use Twitter, people are racist on here, which means you are just as guilty as I am in that article.  So I made fun of him.

So what happens now with this dishonest journalist? We need to wait and see.  Also  @ytcreators  I'd like my monetization back.
* [28 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200502140259/https://twitter.com/CountDankulaTV/status/1256584950373134336) ([live](https://twitter.com/CountDankulaTV/status/1255208671702913024)): As a result, both newspapers and their staff who were spied on are (rightfully so) very fucking mad.  Currently, Mark has been suspended from the Financial Times pending an investigation. He could possibly be losing his job, career and possibly a criminal charge.
* [28 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200502140259/https://twitter.com/CountDankulaTV/status/1256584950373134336) ([live](https://twitter.com/CountDankulaTV/status/1255208670230646792)): In an investigation these accounts were traced back to Mark and the second account he joined with was traced to his personal mobile phone.  Zoom would not give out that type of information which is why some people are theorizing that there could be police involvement.
* [28 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200502140259/https://twitter.com/CountDankulaTV/status/1256584950373134336) ([live](https://twitter.com/CountDankulaTV/status/1255208668762648576)): Mark realises that he fucked up and instantly disconnects and then rejoin the meeting using a different account.  He begins listening to staff being told they are being furloughed, loss of work due to COVID etc.  Mark then starts LIVE TWEETING ALL THIS INFO WHILE IN THE MEETING.
* [28 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200502140259/https://twitter.com/CountDankulaTV/status/1256584950373134336) ([live](https://twitter.com/CountDankulaTV/status/1255208667365945346)): Mark snuck into private staff meetings for The Independent and The Evening Standard newspapers, but despite his years of subterfuge training at Buzzfeed, he fucked up.  By joining the meeting with an account using HIS FINANCIAL TIMES WORK EMAIL, showing his FULL NAME to everyone.
* [28 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200502140259/https://twitter.com/CountDankulaTV/status/1256584950373134336) ([live](https://twitter.com/CountDankulaTV/status/1255208665918967809)): Due to COVID, a lot of workplaces are conducting meetings via Zoom, Zoom is notorious for being lax in security, lots of trolling videos appearing on Youtube of people joining and trolling meetings.  Mark decided to exploit this to gather information.  By spying on rival papers.
* [28 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200502140259/https://twitter.com/CountDankulaTV/status/1256584950373134336) ([live](https://twitter.com/CountDankulaTV/status/1255208664383795206)): Fast forward to today, Mark Di Stefano has been suspended from the Financial Times after just 3 months. So what did he do?  Well the boy fucked up, big time, so much so that it's actually causing problems between major newspapers, and has probably cost him his career.
* [28 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200502140259/https://twitter.com/CountDankulaTV/status/1256584950373134336) ([live](https://twitter.com/CountDankulaTV/status/1255208662605406208)): He however is still doing his usual scheming, he seemed to think that manipulation and crossing the line of what is considered "legal" is just something that you do as a journlist.  He even seems to have an issue with Data Protection laws that protect your private information. pic.twitter.com/PsQ24FJpJ9

Then in January of this year, he gets hired by The Financial Times, a proper "I'm a big boy now" publication, not the type that constantly lies or publishes top ten lists about avocados.
* [28 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200502140259/https://twitter.com/CountDankulaTV/status/1256584950373134336) ([live](https://twitter.com/CountDankulaTV/status/1255208659497476096)): At Buzzfeed he was doing all kinds of subterfuge, lying, getting info by very sinister means, but this is all part and parcel of working at a place like Buzzfeed or other left wing rags.  They don't care about ethics or morals, they care about money, by any means necessary.

If you say you don't like him because "he is literally a fascist reee" then you are a fanny.
