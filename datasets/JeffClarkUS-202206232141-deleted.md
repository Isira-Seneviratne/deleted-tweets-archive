* [17 June 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220617110019/https://twitter.com/JeffClarkUS/status/1537751992273096710): WH Spox Jean-Pierre says they’ll keep moving forward to end fossil fuels despite ever-skyrocketing gas prices. Definition of insanity. https://t.co/KA8lNMIiKC  Good a time as any to again remind folks I spearheaded getting Keystone done and operational for Trump. My 4/13 tweet. https://t.co/lKZYP7dUbI

The bread on the top is good (reject progressive prosecutors). The bread on the bottom is goos (punish Supreme Court Dobbs leakers). But the meat of the sandwich (gun control) is where the poison is https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-boiling-over-of-america-san-fransisco-crime-minority-voters-chesa-boudin-recalled-liberal-democrats-11654810568

And watch for another lockdown to begin in Fall 2022 because of a new pandemic, i.e. monkeypox. Then election irregularity.

Would have ranged from the sublime to the ridiculous — “Are you still secretly working for NATO?” to “Just how did you transition from Harry Potter lounge singer to working in the Ukraine?”

Yet WaPo endlessly pushes J6 stories anyway (a breathless one just appeared yesterday).   https://twitter.com/kjdrennen/status/1519405295876911104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1519405295876911104%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fredstate.com%2Fsister-toldjah%2F2022%2F04%2F28%2Fwatch-chuck-todd-bitterly-admits-democrat-capitol-riot-investigation-ploy-not-going-as-planned-n557228  https://twitter.com/jeffclarkus/status/1519677441689587712

At least The Hill could be more creative and avoid the grammatical problem—e.g., “Person Ignited Self in Front of Supreme Court.” https://twitter.com/thehill/status/1517791902984245249

Reading the article, a stay pending appeal was denied, and a briefing schedule was set in the 4th Circuit.  That’s not a reversal. Maybe you were sleepy today. And earth to HuffPo, nothing was “revived” here. https://twitter.com/tribelaw/status/1513112168828440578

Just needs a quote from Royal Meghan of “Yeah, but it’s different when I, me, use the word ‘archetypes.’” https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10689601/Now-Meghan-tries-trademark-word-archetypes.html

Politics 101 but also the kind of insight that seems obvious only AFTER it’s revealed but that Presslee was the first to think of, so kudos!   #ItsTheGasPricesStupid  https://twitter.com/scottpresler/status/1501294538580762624
