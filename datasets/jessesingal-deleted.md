I did far more work trying to put these numbers into cotext for a brief, paywalled Substack than he did for an article on the website of a major think tank https://www.city-journal.org/abuse-in-schools-no-conspiracy-theory
* [12 April 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220412181614/https://twitter.com/jessesingal/status/1513943976868560922): In 15 years these will be seen as the most obvious points in the world and people will act like they didn't send us deranged torture-porn shit over it. There will be a lot of Who Me??? about the blacklists and the other bullshit
* [12 April 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220412173015/https://twitter.com/jessesingal/status/1513932412446810115): In the latest battle of False Claim versus Debunking, Debunking has once again prevailed.   The season series stands at 392,394,501,382 - 0, False Claim. pic.twitter.com/r4qtUO7WYd

I want it to be the case that psychedelics will be as revolutionary to treating mental-health problems as their most enthusiastic proponents claim, but every serious flaw in the research Eiko mentions is a serious one. https://twitter.com/EikoFried/status/1513829020428816391
* [12 April 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220412155855/https://twitter.com/jessesingal/status/1513909389287112704): 3/ Sure but this doesn't actually *work* - w/a few small exceptions (Alex Jones getting the YouTube boot), attempts to ban stuff always spread the thing in question far and wide. All this does is make liberal institutions ever crazier and more insular   https://twitter.com/StephenDDudek/status/1513908921085444099

* [11 April 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220411002512/https://twitter.com/jessesingal/status/1513312094476713992): 2/ One of the demands was that Lindo dissolve all her past business agreements w/r/t ghostwriting etc  This is reasonable and normal stuff -- a healthy community just seeking justice https://twitter.com/marquisele/status/1512535790148014081

No more migration from the Middle East. We must break up the present countries into warring chiefdoms and everyone has to go back to the patch of undeveloped mud their ancestors lived on, where they warred over potatoes for centuries.
* [ 8 April 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220408201901/https://twitter.com/jessesingal/status/1512525286944002056): Don't always agree with Wesley but this is... exactly what he's saying? The kids were convinced by adults they'd been abused?  Very confused by this interaction. Maybe I should be less online naw never mind clearly I should quadruple down on Twitter. pic.twitter.com/eeBktHtQhA
* [ 8 April 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220408013444/https://twitter.com/jessesingal/status/1512242259579838467): There are few more serious warning signs that someone has a really bad personality, and that you should be wary about their presence in your life, than them attempting to exert control over who you associate with in any way, online or off

There's nothing remotely offensive in the comments. In my experience it's seen as inherently bigoted to raise any qualms about these treatments. pic.twitter.com/rbuK2CKKvf

* [ 7 April 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220407170448/https://twitter.com/jessesingal/status/1512113326213545995): 2/ Some light background reading befre you tune in: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/14/us/adolph-reed-controversy.html

* [ 7 April 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220407021508/https://twitter.com/jessesingal/status/1511890163517038593): 2/ I'm trying to check a potential critique of my article on this paper and it is very very hard to even understand what is happening, over time, with the three groups (medicine, no-medicine, and dropped out). It doesn't help that I can't even figure out the basic numbers.
* [ 7 April 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220407021413/https://twitter.com/jessesingal/status/1511889985422729224): Very long day so I'm gonna throw this to the hive mind. Am I missing something or should the numbers in the same-colored boxes be the same? They should, right? pic.twitter.com/sL6oJ5ykKx
* [ 5 April 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220405164326/https://twitter.com/jessesingal/status/1511383791801147394): 2/ They have a level of vindictiveness we lack -- constantly trying to get people fired, to dictate who is allowed to say what, and to engage in reputational napalming of anyone with even mild disagreement. The difference between Imani and Katie on actual substance is miniscule.
* [ 5 April 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220405164326/https://twitter.com/jessesingal/status/1511383791801147394): Herzog's crime was telling the story of detransitioners in an article that also featured happy transitioners.These people are insane, man. I've tried so many times to engage but it's not worth it. They barely have fully-formed beliefs -- it's just endless vendetta and obsession. pic.twitter.com/T7sBbRgpVx
* [ 4 April 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220404233457/https://twitter.com/jessesingal/status/1511125111604195328): 5/ She appears to have taken data provided by 8th through 11th graders and said "Let's assume that's the rate of vitcimization at all age levels," which seems pretty nuts. Obviously teenagers are much more likely to be sexually victimized than preteens. pic.twitter.com/aIFjvlD5kX
* [ 4 April 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220404233457/https://twitter.com/jessesingal/status/1511125111604195328) ([live](https://twitter.com/jessesingal/status/1511122760189284360)): 4/ As far as I can tell he is getting this 100x 'stat' from one researcher whose methods were scrutinized. I'll look more into this when I have time but it is just not credible given the sex difference in perpetration rates. pic.twitter.com/eOTw97lbfL
* [ 4 April 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220404233457/https://twitter.com/jessesingal/status/1511125111604195328) ([live](https://twitter.com/jessesingal/status/1511121054864916487)): 3/ Rufo is claiming that a group that is 67% female (teachers) commits sexual abuse at a MUCH higher rate than a group is 100% male (Catholic priests). I know you're not to say that this or that social science theory is 'impossible,' but this is pretty close. pic.twitter.com/81Gw9gCwY6
* [ 4 April 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220404233457/https://twitter.com/jessesingal/status/1511125111604195328) ([live](https://twitter.com/jessesingal/status/1511115029910892550)): 2/ If Chris is right it means Catholic priests are far kid-rapier than teachers pic.twitter.com/PD9s58cxDN

At one of the top hospitals in the world, there was a major coverup scandal involving blockers, with kids suffering major physical and psychological probelms. https://www.svtplay.se/video/33358590/uppdrag-granskning/mission-investigate-trans-children-avsnitt-1?position=689&id=jp9dBRA

You can oppose the proposed and enacted laws/policies in red states without exaggerating the evidence.
* [31 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220331215202/https://twitter.com/jessesingal/status/1509649638130954244) ([live](https://twitter.com/jessesingal/status/1509609039604465666)): U.S. versus U.K. governments on the question of whether puberty blockers should be seen as full-stop reversible pic.twitter.com/gybwsa2lgv

* [24 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220324031124/https://twitter.com/jessesingal/status/1506830978190348290): The argument here seems to be that I erred in claiming NHJ, a journalist who has won the Pulitzer and MacArthur awards, not to mention countless others, has sufficient job security that she doesn't risk firing as a result of an online mob. That anyone could argue with this... https://twitter.com/shanenrhoades/status/1506745224248315907

It's made-up.
* [18 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220318214109/https://twitter.com/jessesingal/status/1504935935166844930): 2/ You see this claim a lot but what's amazing about it is one of the groups LEAST likely to say this stuff is a concern is... liberal white people! It's just like an exact 180ing of the actual racial politics.
* [18 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220318213852/https://twitter.com/jessesingal/status/1504935356109660171): "At the same time, a full 84 percent of Black people polled shared the concern of this editorial that it was a “very serious” or “somewhat serious” problem that some Americans do not exercise their freedom of speech out of fear of retaliation or harsh criticism." https://twitter.com/drvolts/status/1504877988319404032

* [18 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220318211008/https://twitter.com/jessesingal/status/1504928014920044550): 2/ Anyway I'm in Havana and I'll make sure to see if Cubans share this outrage at the idea that it is bad to foster a culture of punishment for unpopular speech.
* [18 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220318210859/https://twitter.com/jessesingal/status/1504927707565539328): This view, that a relatively milquetoast editorial arguing the left has a free-speech problem (while denouncing "an even more extreme version of censoriousness" on the right) is such an indefensible act that it might warrant staff resignation, is dominant among lib media types. https://twitter.com/adamdavidson/status/1504808498646949889

It's hard for anyone born in the U.S. in the last very many years to imagine the widespread, full-blown suppression of free speech (notwithstanding disturbing outlying cases like J20). But thinks can change very quickly!
* [16 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220316010456/https://twitter.com/jessesingal/status/1503899971657027589) ([live](https://twitter.com/jessesingal/status/1503897175037726723)): Between Russia and China, ~1.5 billion people live in terrifying dystopias when it comes to the government's near-total ability to control and punish disfavored speech. It shocks me Americans are so blind to the dangers of giving government and tech more power on this front.

Official travel to those states is also forbidden.

How is this different? Is it just that because this is a bad bill (from our perspective), it's okay for our outlets to misrepresent it?
* [13 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220313211630/https://twitter.com/jessesingal/status/1503117672137076739): First two paragraphs of a NYT column. Everyone knows this is false. Everyone knows there is nothing like this anywhere in the bill (the only part about sexual orientation refers explicitly to "classroom instruction," anyway).
