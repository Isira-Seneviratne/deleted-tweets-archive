The overwhelming majority of Americans who favor socialism want the latter, and they’re not going to be dissuaded by evoking Venezuela, Cuba, or the USSR. https://twitter.com/dbongino/status/1102314330337538048

People are finally beginning to recognize that the establishment right is as much of an obstacle as the left.
* [ 2 March 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190302145630/https://twitter.com/PatrickCaseyIE/status/1101665530770001920): It must hurt to know that Nick foregoing mainstream acceptance netted him far more relevance and followers than your opportunistic establishment striving—you did everything they told you to, but to your dismay you’ve found that you’re still too uninteresting to matter. https://twitter.com/SearsAl/status/1101585824364281858

* [ 1 March 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190302012748/https://twitter.com/patrickcaseyie/status/1101543069214748673?lang=en-gb): He’s claiming that the return on investment for our financial contributions (welfare) to Israel is massive.   Consider me unconvinced.   #CPAC2019

* [28 February 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190228193906/https://twitter.com/PatrickCaseyIE/status/1101204504043769859): Regardless of what you think of Nick, he traded a lucrative career in Conservatism Inc. for far less remunerative one in the dissident right, all because he dared criticize Israel and demographic change. https://twitter.com/Hundwyn/status/1101202368325128192

This is more or less where I've been for 16 months, and it's where the broader right – conservatives included – is headed as well.

Make no mistake, remedying these issue will require government intervention, given that the source of the problem appears to be the federal government itself.

But actively misleading people is something else altogether, and by now I'd wager more of your supporters are approaching racial consciousness than you might think...
