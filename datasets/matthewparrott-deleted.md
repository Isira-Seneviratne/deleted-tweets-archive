* [19 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190919005925/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174486473187438592): His basic shtick here is for aging whores, hissing and spitting at any calls for improved morals, dragging all of humanity down to her level.  It's slave morality for thots.
* [19 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190919005156/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174484846611259392): Very alinskyite of you to try to hold us accountable to our own rules.  My record of propriety in such matters is a scandal of its own.
* [19 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190919004806/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174482724565999616): Since we oppose degeneracy, we're always going to be fighting an uphill battle given that some of our guys are hypocrites.  You can't be a hypocrite if you never claimed to stand for anything, after all.
* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190919001243/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174472078227058688): You're correct.

* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190918224758/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174453180106756098): It was a perfect storm of leftist lawsuits, a massive putsch from the amnats, and then an internal scandal all at the same time.  TradWorker is still alive, fighting the lawsuits and working on prisoner support. But it's no longer a membership organization.
* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190918222059/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174446153519288321): You know we're missing out on where the best lulz are being had in random maga facebook groups where this is being dropped.

* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190918220128/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174440659635331073): She's in her preteen shitlib stage all autistic savants go through, and should strike terror into the hearts of anybody and everybody who isn't an anarcho-primitivist.
* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190918215934/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174439325767000066): ⚰️

* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190918210037/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174426223176572932): "Modernism" is itself White Supremacist, insisting that white/western reality is truly objective, with all others as primitive and/or superstitious.
* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190918210037/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174426223176572932): Trump is 21st century white supremacy, desperately insisting that the browns are being fully employed and cared for by the white overlords who most certainly, definitely, don't deserve an identitarian slave revolt.
* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190918210037/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174426223176572932): White Nationalism was born as a euphemism by and for white supremacists. The metapolitics of nationalism are integrally anti-colonial and largely incommensurate with the White American mind, save for some Jacksonian/Copperhead strains.
* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190918205020/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174423934948859905): Racialism is absolutely true, just as familyism is true.  I don't need to despise other people's kids or wish harm on them to love and prefer my own.
* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190918201916/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174415638221262850): I want to see the "threats."  With these people, a white man talking back to a politician is a hate crime. https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdva/pr/florida-man-arrested-making-racially-motivated-threats-interference-election

* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190918192816/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174401686124867584): We already tried that.  It got subverted. pic.twitter.com/mDtmKVFLQr

* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190918192029/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174400975655845889): That, and leftist radicals are objectively superior to conservative nationalist types.

* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190918184457/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174390283003473920): It is, with most altright types being sassy Republicans who reject any truly revolutionary ideology or action.
* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190918184457/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174390283003473920): Nope.  He's breast understood as a Republican "Kanye Contrarian" who believes that all his community's problems can be resolved by more capitalist hustling.
* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190918184223/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174390275973767170): Like the white bourgeoisie, he's got that "I got mine" attitude and sees the escalating racial violence as entertainment. As with ALL black men who aren't black nationalists, he's not actually pro-black.
* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190918184223/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174390275973767170): Hotep Jesus doesn't wish to defuse or resolve America's racial problems, but cheer on his team in the bumfights from his nice, comfy apartment in a white neighborhood.
* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190918184223/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174390275973767170): He doesn't listen, and he doesn't care, because he's a black chauvinist who finds it hilarious when black mobs gang up on and attack lone white men in broad daylight.
* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190918184223/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174390275973767170): The White Nationalist community in America has our fun and makes our jokes. But our basic bargain with Black America is far more honest and equitable than anything the mainstream offers: Black community agency, accountability, and empowerment.
* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190918184223/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174390275973767170): TradWorker's response after Ferguson was that the solution to BLM was to have the police force reflect the local community as well as possible.  This was exactly what  @HotepJesus  claims we're not doing.
* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190918180415/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174381962854895617): Could you please deport Olga,  @realDonaldTrump ? Thanks.

* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190918182213/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174379477943627777): He's definitely in the talented tenth!
* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190918181743/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174373111342489600): Muslims don't have an infinite army of conservative middle class thumb people who will hysterically attack anybody and everybody who steps up to confront the enemy.
* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190918173618/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174374117941944321): Yeah.  Developing a celebrity that people buy friendship and access to is absolutely the best way to secure independent funding.  Now lemme tell you about how that idea can backfire....
* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190918174922/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174376050698149889): How long will Uncle Sam remain a conspicuously nordish archetype?  I feel like there needs to be some cheesy national competition where we can nominate some chubby mixed race girl in a wheelchair to be our national mascot.
* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190918173618/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174374117941944321): You see this play out with the AltLite Trumpers, who started off national populist but now constantly suck off Zionism.
* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190918180024/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174373739561197569): My case against full time altright at this stage is on account of distrust of the donors.  They almost ALWAYS have an agenda and it's almost ALWAYS a distraction from or betrayal of the beneficiary's work.
* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190918181743/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174373111342489600): I fucking love how the media reports Iran's defiant replies to our claims we're going to attack them as if they're being belligerent.  "This guy claims he might fight back if I punch him. I better go kick his ass!"
* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190918174202/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174367873139167232): It's easy enough to align the incentives to where healthier and more capable folks reproduce at a dramatically higher rate without the need for a single anti-natal gesture.
* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190918174202/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174367873139167232): Sounds like you're also VaporTrad: fighting for perennial values and virtues with no loyalty toward or interest in the remnants and remains of institutions and traditions which once manifested them.
* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190918171611/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174365585603530754): There won't necessarily be a "collapse," but rather a severe disruption as finance is transformed by devolutionary technology in the same manner everything else is being transformed.
* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190918173423/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174358788817772545): Ethereum is only a few months away from being capable of tokenized single-blind loan instruments and ZERO RESERVE investment in those instruments.
* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190918173423/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174358788817772545): That would make sense if the fundamentals of high finance weren't about to be kicked out from under them.
* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190918171737/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174349881365991426): Because you have a blog which I have read extensively, ma'am.  You are indeed contrarian and open minded, but the general framework remains susceptible to this critique.
* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190918163637/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174356846532091905): They eventually get quietly sold off for their uranium by people who are far more concerned about affordable clean power than about megastate brinkmanship games.
* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190918163637/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174356846532091905): Tech is the cycle.  Technology, often but not always military, dictates the scale.
* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190918162322/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174358261262426112): @robwinfield35 @cashmoneyglock @AnonnyChick I'm against tattoos.  As you know, I am entirely disinterested in the entryist approach, though.

* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190918163637/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174356846532091905): False.  This notion that history always favors scale is entirely unsupported by history.  Behold the Roman Empire's devolution for a thousand years into itty bitty city-states.
* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190918163637/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174356846532091905): A useful correlate may be the Scottish and Appalachian clans, where your greatest concern is matriarchs and patriarchs who can hold you socially accountable, with a concomitant heat death of mass society.
* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190918163128/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174356167818207233): Even lower, down to churches, communities, perhaps even approaching the Dunbar Number.
* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190918172311/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174354058775334912): And without monolithic, centralized power structures, invasive managerial elites will prove incapable of the incredible scale of power projection they currently enjoy.
* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190918172311/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174354058775334912): The devolution and democratization of technology will force a scaling down of the loci of authority just as 20th century nuclear technology forced a scaling up.  The orwellian superstates are obsolete and steadily draining authority.
* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190918172311/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174354058775334912): They're superior because civilization rewards patience and complex systems management.  Whites are superior leaders and innovators, but inferior managers and maintainers.  We're an impatient and easily distracted bunch of daydreamers.
* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190918172311/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174354058775334912): The mechanics are simple.  Civilizations are conceived by neolithic martial elites, but cosmopolitan managerial/mercantile elites are genetically and memetically superior at the civilizational habitat.
* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190918171737/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174349881365991426): You tell me who's being targeted in an arrangement where "white people" are blamed but one can buy their way out of any and every "racial justice" measure.  White Privilege theory is a White Elite conspiracy against the white working class and the white working class alone.
* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190918161926/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174347850186207233): I'm talking about very recent technological progress.  Bitcoin, public key cryptography, and the napsterization of managerial cartels.
* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190918171737/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174349881365991426): The white working class can and will strive toward equitable solutions mindful of the concerns you raise right after it fights through your paradigm which frames it as the living embodiment of the problem.
* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190918160722/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174348772417183745): Pro-Tip: If you mute him, your timeline will be refreshingly devoid of his smug brainlet cold takes.

Technological progress has broken the pump and we're all heading for a post-civilized neo-tribal, meta-feudal world order we can only hope to vaguely outline or understand at this point.
* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190918161042/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174347007105937413): Catholic priestly celibacy resulted in a martial (aristocratic) and managerial (catholic) symphonia that lasted about a millennium before colonialism enriched the merchants and (((merchants))), initiating our Mercantile Age.

Civilization works kind of like a star, and we're in our red giant phase shortly before burning out.
* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190918154531/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174344255919276037): A group of people is actively out to get my people.  I better literally brand myself to avoid any confusion.
* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190918160909/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174343432480940033): If you don't know what cancel culture is, ... you're already canceled. 💁🏽‍♀️

* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190918162054/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174331263643246597): "I'm happy for them and wish them the best, but we'll allow homeowner's associations to choose who lives in their neighborhoods. You'll be able to ban nazis from yours and mine can be lily-white."
* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190918171400/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174328726236123136): It's more difficult to dehumanize the "villain" when your coat got caught on the chairlift that one time and he tried to rescue you while you were flying in mid air, and you both ended up face down in a slushy pit of snow.
* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190918175417/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174330108682874893): Yup.  Arriving at a rhetoric that's authentically pro-white and can survive meatspace requires that thoughtful critique of colonialism and neocolonialism.
* [18 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190918145941/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1174327589319503872): Indeed. I end up happily forfeiting a lot of online debates with anonymous accounts who draw a harder line than I'm willing to draw with some of these issues.

Objective, demonstrable reality is no match for their incestuous little echo chamber.

Re-read that until it sinks in. They can never see their families again over some potential wage garnishments.  That's hysterical, in both senses of the term.

Heimbach and I spoke with the local cops at length, coming up with a standard event plan not unlike every other event I've organized.

The sheriff can tell the FBI what you told him, and vice-versa.  Cantwell has recently taken to involving feds in movement drama, which speaks to his need for a long sabbatical.

The solution is simple: Talk to local cops when appropriate about immediate legal and logistical issues.

This necessarily entails being the "bad guys" to people who literally still think Joe Biden and Israel are the "good guys." We're preparing for a new frame, not trying to win at this one.

I don't care how swarthy they are. White is just shorthand for "European racial stock," and fully includes the Meds as true equals of Nords, Celts, Slavs, and whatever the fuck Finns are.

Doing so forces you guys to apologize for me existing, and implies that I support a lot of Trump's agenda that I flatly do not.  We'll do our best to be useful on the common interests.

It's doubly aggravating that those who fled back to the garage and were assaulted while doing so caught the REAL charges. Lose/Lose

I was running back and forth thinking they would try to go around the shield wall at the steps, but they never thought to do that for some reason. No strategic planning on their side.

You are absolutely correct that it was not only NF doing the fighting.

The official historical account will bear no resemblance to what actually happened, and I'm powerless to correct it.
* [26 April 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190504112027/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1121875303733895169?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw): Several hundred people showed up in Charlottesville thinking they were attending a broad, ecumenical rally in support of the Robert E Lee statue.  It's likely that the outright majority of attendees had no clue about white nationalist groups like my own being invited to attend.
* [26 April 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190504112027/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1121875303733895169?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw): My position is not partisan propaganda, but can be verified by a wealth of unbiased third-party accounts, namely the very comprehensive Heaphy Report, which debunks the false media narrative and proves systemic law enforcement malfeasance and dereliction.

* [26 April 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190504112027/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1121875303733895169?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw): But the tactical decision proved a PR disaster, as it invited the narrative that the event was pretty much entirely nazi goons (self-inclusive). We weren't even invited until the last minute, and only then because of our value as human shields.

It worked out very well, logistically, with our side holding the permitted zone despite being wildly outnumbered and (literally) outgunned.

The normies, who numbered in the several hundreds, were clustered safely by the Guard away from Market St.

What happened is that when things got dangerous, an informed decision was made to throw the racial radicals to the front, to face down the antifa.
* [26 April 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190504112027/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1121875303733895169?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw): Just as with the "Russian Collusion," you have this case where the leftist media tries with all of its heart to force a narrative that's outright counterfactual. But those of us who were there saw the several non-white UTR attendees fighting alongside us. Trump is correct.
* [26 April 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190504112027/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1121875303733895169?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw): The media will continue trying to crucify him over and over again over his statement of fact, which is that truly evil people (self-inclusive) who dare to believe the evil idea that white people deserve dignity and a future, too, were not the only or even the largest population.
* [26 April 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190504112027/https://twitter.com/MatthewParrott/status/1121875303733895169?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw): Trump made his famous "good people on both sides" remark because he had an intelligence brief from the feds confirming that the majority of Charlottesville attendees were MAGAtards. The majority of attendees were indeed, non-WN MAGAtards.
