They arrived clad in black for the sole purpose of intimidating a vendor. If the Mayor's concerned about violence breaking out, it's obvious he thinks that will come from antifa.

At the top, a girl in her late 20s asked what our banner said—when I told her it read “end immigration,” she became silent.

I don’t think they took too kindly to our action—not that they had a say, though, of course.

Today, IE activists hiked the Block U with a massive banner that read "END IMMIGRATION" to let the university – and the world – know that we will NOT be stopped! pic.twitter.com/Jzkkm4z5n1

With the 2020 election around the corner,  @realDonaldTrump  needs to do whatever it takes to start construction on the wall.
