You literally don‚Äôt know what nationalism is. Nationalism is an attitude. It‚Äôs also highly heritable‚Ä¶across nations.

Even if you picked the lowest number you‚Äôd only stop world hunger for 29 years. Not like permanently eradicate starvation or death. Might fck up unstable nations even worse, too.

Brains but not minds are computational

Not that we know it in any other sense than statistically. If the mean height of US men is 5‚Äô8‚Äù, and I randomly selected an individual, you‚Äôd have no guess as to what height he would be? 10 ft might be reasonable?

To randomly select an individual and estimate that he eats 10 sc/wk is the best estimate possible based on the data.

Such that, wherever differences do exist, they‚Äôre entirely attributed to different forms of racism, rather than other possibilities. Eg cultural/subcultural differences in values.

Obviously the problem would be that a biracial student was being forces to admit his inherent white supremacy. Do you think this instance has no relation to CRT?

Eg having their children taught that they are inherently racist at very young ages. Seems justifiable from these pics

So in your opinion was there male-ish, female-ish, and residual asexually reproducing organisms in the population?

I suppose you could say that one strategy was male and one was female.

So at first there was only one sex/reproductive strategy, then selection pressures slowly divided into two. So was the initial one male or female? Derp neither. So ‚Äúneither‚Äù is an appropriate category

Idk what  @rjhaier  was saying specifically, but I doubt he used a single IQ measure to tell you you should be a dancer vs physicist. Perhaps provided a range of professions given individual IQ
