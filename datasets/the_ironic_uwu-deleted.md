They need to vilify me because I'm moderate and make sense- that distorts their reality, so they lash out. Thats my theory at least lol
* [ 2 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210902194110/https://twitter.com/the_ironic_uwu/status/1433508417704955911): I agree.
* [ 2 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210902192657/https://twitter.com/the_ironic_uwu/status/1433506446709334018): For example, a woman who is dealing with severe mental health issues, it won't qualify as life-threatening. Some other reasons too, but I am tired and cannot pull them out of the back of my mind, lol
* [ 2 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210902194231/https://twitter.com/the_ironic_uwu/status/1433504239607816192): No.

"Just because men don’t physically carry a baby doesn’t mean they aren’t a full partner in the process." Yes that is exactly what that means. 2. I mentioned nothing about child support.
* [ 2 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210902190931/https://twitter.com/the_ironic_uwu/status/1433503103857352709): Of course. Safe sex is crucial. I can agree with that.
* [ 2 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210902193846/https://twitter.com/the_ironic_uwu/status/1433503817841188865): I'm not in support of abortion for no reason. I'm just not supporting strict abortion regulation by gov because women often fall through the cracks and are forced to birth when they really can't.
* [ 2 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210902191916/https://twitter.com/the_ironic_uwu/status/1433503395575476225): So have you had premarital sex?
* [ 2 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210902190931/https://twitter.com/the_ironic_uwu/status/1433503103857352709): And what do you suggest women should do?
* [ 2 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210902190943/https://twitter.com/the_ironic_uwu/status/1433502344537329664): The "yikes" is rude. You can have safe sex, but the tweet I was commenting on talked about avoiding it altogether. Have you ever had sex with someone who you weren't married to?
* [ 2 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210902191012/https://twitter.com/the_ironic_uwu/status/1433501942630731778): Oh gosh, I posted a heartfelt thing about how pregnancy is more than "carrying a baby" (from my personal experience of dealing with health issues in pregnancy) and now everyone thinks I'm pushing mandatory child support and killing babies.  ...that was fast.
* [ 2 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210902191051/https://twitter.com/the_ironic_uwu/status/1433501594432282631): Stop deflecting from the issue.
* [ 2 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210902191209/https://twitter.com/the_ironic_uwu/status/1433501464626929664): 1. Sex is a part of life.  2. I said nothing about child support.
* [ 2 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210902190419/https://twitter.com/the_ironic_uwu/status/1433501287404933126): Avoiding sex is not realistic.
* [ 2 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210902190307/https://twitter.com/the_ironic_uwu/status/1433501029593661447): I didn't say any of that, but ok.
* [ 2 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210902191847/https://twitter.com/the_ironic_uwu/status/1433500875176226819): Nowhere did I say that a man has absolutely no say.
* [ 2 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210902190100/https://twitter.com/the_ironic_uwu/status/1433499096388673538): Respectfully disagree. Though men need to be allowed to talk about the pain of abortion more, they still take a backseat when it comes to pregnancy/abortion debate. Why? Because pregnancy isn't just carrying a baby. It's hormones, mental health, life threatening issues sometimes.
* [ 2 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210902181517/https://twitter.com/the_ironic_uwu/status/1433483064580218882): I view it as a philosophy because men can be feminists too. It's just about women not being judged for being women; but rather the content of their character. Like, women can be doctors. And women dont deserve violence. Etc. However, that's MY version of feminism I adhere to.
* [ 2 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210902181553/https://twitter.com/the_ironic_uwu/status/1433481294537703427): THIS is why abortion shouldn't be heavily regulated by government. IMHO. Pregnancies are complex and very individual and complications can arise in ways the law doesn't recognize as "life saving." https://www.huffpost.com/entry/anti-abortion-law-pregnancy-complications_n_612ff3f9e4b05f53eda3008c
* [ 2 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210902135842/https://twitter.com/the_ironic_uwu/status/1433420948833722369): Agreed completely.
* [ 2 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210902134706/https://twitter.com/the_ironic_uwu/status/1433419956935401472): What is it
* [ 2 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210902134056/https://twitter.com/the_ironic_uwu/status/1433419616106254338): I think its strictly made out of emotional reactions.
* [ 2 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210902132057/https://twitter.com/the_ironic_uwu/status/1433419245002575877): Thank you. Yeah I'm not freaking out like everyone lol. Just a bit concerned that those things are even being debated in a judicial system still. But I am the first to admit I haven't been following much.
* [ 2 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210902131308/https://twitter.com/the_ironic_uwu/status/1433416619783598082): It shows that its not about life or autonomy. Its not logic
* [ 2 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210902131616/https://twitter.com/the_ironic_uwu/status/1433417090980098052): I think its relatively good to be aware and concerned when governments limit the rights of pregnant women on how they react to obstacles in their pregnancies.
* [ 2 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210902131308/https://twitter.com/the_ironic_uwu/status/1433416619783598082): I don't think its the governments place to place this many restrictions around abortion and birth control, as it gets really difficult to apply in reality in a way where some women don't get forced to birth when they cant for very real reasons.
* [ 2 September 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210902012223/https://twitter.com/the_ironic_uwu/status/1433235402085871618): im sorry to hear you are..that whats the prognosis?

I'm also certain G-d is blessing me with the serenity aspect of quitting bad habits like vaping, skin picking, etc. Elul has been interesting and full of really dark revelations about where I am and where I want to be.
