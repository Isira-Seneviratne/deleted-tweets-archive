The law is enough in many cases. Results in destruction of abortion infrastructure and will decrease abortions overall. Those that are done won't be done with the approval of the state, which is good.   Also, hi neighbor :) <!--1524959699543760918-->

Roe is based upon the 'right to privacy'. Do some research on Roe beforehand. Additionally, appealing to mass opinion is not an argument. The majority opinion is not always the correct one.

Under 1% of abortions are for rape, incest, or because the mother's life is at risk. The rest are simply murder for the sake of murder. That should be punished. Additionally, punishing murders is not anti-democratic. Democracy is simply a form of government. <!--1524922878268829698-->

Give it another 500 years, though?

They are a regional population that is different from the majority Anglo culture.

But they are still not completely so. Canada, for example, has the French-Canadians.

For example, "kindergarten" is a German tradition, brought over by German immigrants. It's now an integral part of our schooling system. <!--1519344132413612032-->

We are a young nation and people, and although we had an other to quickly center ourselves on, we are not fully formed as a people. Only recently have wide sects of Whites begun identifying as "American" and not another group. <!--1519343788048941056-->

Mainly due to the fact that a majority of the identity that White Americans base themselves in is rooted in English traditions, speech, etc. <!--1519343422829740032-->

They are who other assimilate to, or should. They simply created a new identity based out of being American. <!--1519331974594322432-->

Etruscans did not survive, they became Roman and Italian. Same with Europeans who went to America. It's a fact of life. <!--1519329681840951298-->

You still have a common other you can unite over. The differences between a Southerner and a White Californian are small in comparison to a Black or Mexican. <!--1519327059545362433-->

Whites have culture, it just so happens that American Whites have their own unique culture, not any crude imitation of a European ethnicity's culture. <!--1519323796062281729-->

The birth of the American identity was similar to the birth of any identity. There was White Americans, who banded together on a shared dislike and othering of Blacks. This is similar to the birth of any nationalist ID. https://twitter.com/TurnipMerchant/status/1519321062542131201 <!--1519322371886182400-->

Thus, all Europeans eventually assimilated to the White American identity and have a common heritage, culture, and identity due to Blacks being the "other" https://twitter.com/WallaceCarden/status/1519320313347026945 <!--1519321650109370368-->

You cannot act as if either the English or any other European ethnicity are still intact. Being a (White) Nationalist in America requires being an American Nationalist. https://twitter.com/TurnipMerchant/status/1519306612778979328 <!--1519320313347026945-->

Regardless, American should have assimilated the Euros that immigrated here. <!--1519316897820405760-->
