He is asking Spencer if I ever called or texted with him in planning the political protest he was scheduled to speak at.  Bloch‚Äôs voice and demeanor seem to be insinuating a nefarious purpose where the evidence does not suggest one.

He says he does not want to rule over them.  He realizes they are referencing the recorded tirade where he bragged about his ancestors enslaving other races.  He apologizes profusely and says he was stressed out.
