For this reason, the 2024 election will be extremely significant. https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/21/opinion/tucker-carlson.html#click=https://t.co/LgZjoNJUpD

An environmental movement that supports mass immigration from the third world into Western nations, where man's carbon footprint is far greater, clearly harbors ulterior motives.

* [22 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190922190006/https://twitter.com/AIM_America/status/1175847159075393537): Is the Great Replacement a conspiracy theory?   No, of course not. The fact of the matter is that white people *are* becoming minorities in many Western nations. This process isn't accidental or natural – it's largely the result of government policies, which can be undone.
* [22 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190922190006/https://twitter.com/AIM_America/status/1175847159075393537): The term "conspiracy theory" is employed by the establishment to convince brainwashed people to stay away from wrongthink. Within this context, it functionally connects the obvious reality of demographic change with loony theories about lizard people living inside the earth.
* [22 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190922190006/https://twitter.com/AIM_America/status/1175847159075393537): Understanding the Great Replacement  -Low fertility in the West + mass immigration from the third world = demographic replacement -This process is openly supported in full or part by academia, media, NGOs, politicians -Why? Because these entities benefit directly or indirectly
* [22 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190922183048/https://twitter.com/AIM_America/status/1175838360633511936): American Identity Movement remains staunchly opposed to violence, extremism, and supremacism of all ideological stripes.   We instead advocate for cultural and political change through peaceful, lawful activism and networking.  More about AIM: https://www.americanidentitymovement.com/about/

Cracking down on lawful dissent – equating peaceful identitarians with violent lunatics – is a thinly-veiled will to power from a globalist ruling class.
* [22 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190922183048/https://twitter.com/AIM_America/status/1175838360633511936): The newly outlined goals of the DHS regarding "white nationalism" are fourfold.  If applied to terrorists, this framework could conceivably prevent violence; however, given that white nationalist terrorism is mostly a myth, it's more likely that lawful dissidents will suffer. pic.twitter.com/m4S9s0uVyh

Make no mistake, we are witnessing the first stages of the criminalization of lawful and non-violent dissent. https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/white-nationalism-is-now-recognized-as-a-major-terror-threat-by-the-department-of-homeland-security

* [20 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190920043557/https://twitter.com/AIM_America/status/1174901533407756295): And it should noted that most "conservative" pundits who defend corporations silencing Americans are simply doing so because they're paid to do so. Period. They don't care about the American people – they're mere opportunists, carrying water for our globalist ruling class.
* [20 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190920043557/https://twitter.com/AIM_America/status/1174901533407756295): As nationalists, we boast higher values than corporate freedom – what matters ultimately is the welfare of the American nation. This is why we shouldn't be afraid to use state power to secure our objectives.
* [20 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190920043557/https://twitter.com/AIM_America/status/1174901533407756295): Whenever these issues come up, establishment conservatives – the usual suspects – are quick to raise concerns about "big gubmint," arguing that, because PayPal, Facebook, etc. are private companies, they should have the right to deny service as they see fit.
* [20 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190920043557/https://twitter.com/AIM_America/status/1174901533407756295): Make no mistake, it will require state intervention to remedy the twin issues of censorship and deplatforming.  This is why nationalism, not libertarianism, is the way forward.
* [20 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190920042200/https://twitter.com/AIM_America/status/1174900617610838016): Payment processor deplatforming is one of the most troublesome issues we face. There's no reason why American citizens should be denied the ability to digitally exchange money because of their political views.  These services should be utilities, freely available to all. https://twitter.com/NickJFuentes/status/1174887668213305347

We need an immigration system that puts Americans first – not foreigners and big business. https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/09/19/sen-mike-lees-green-card-giveaway-for-big-tech-blocked-in-senate-for-now/

While Trump has admittedly faced obstacles in his quest to secure our southern border, resting on nonexistent laurels is a surefire way to ensure nothing gets done. https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-tours-border-barrier-as-part-of-a-show-of-force-on-immigration-ahead-of-reelection-campaign/2019/09/18/04794cbc-da2c-11e9-ac63-3016711543fe_story.html
