The judge just said he wasn't considering it.  That isn't a ruling, and is legally impossible.  Either the second amended filing stands, or the first one does.

Demanding a piece of paper when you have the contracting party testifying to it is holding the party to a higher standard than prima facie.

Judge made many errors, for both sides, we'll talk about them honestly and talk about what's next!

Losing is always a kick in the balls, especially when there were real problems with that court room.  And to be clear, the only reason the other side isn't complaining about chupp is favorable outcomes.

Since I'm in a hotel and have a pretty full schedule today it may not be until tomorrow.  But don't lose hope.  A sober analysis of yesterday and the path forward are coming.

Convincing the judge that something he argued over specifically (Jamie's actual defamatory statement) somehow wasn't part of the record, was magnificent.  And I mean that with all sincerity.

Also NOT ruled on conspiracy for Rial and Toye.  Dismissed all other causes.  Some dismissals are clearly questionable, but the next step is strategically what, if anything, you challenge.   @nonetosee  https://twitter.com/nonetosee/status/1170056016681144320

The idea that patronage developed into crowdfunding isn't particularly earth-shattering or even challenging.  Heck, it's almost like there's a platform that borrows the language from it.

What if any number of things happen?  The lawyers are apparently going to just work for free, for years, without pursuing their clients?  Sure, buddy.

The lawyers have a fee arrangement with their clients, not with Vic, and the judgment doesn't absolve them of their fee arrangement outside of a specific agreement.  So, the lawyers are owed by the clients who are owed by Vic.  Who is going to pay the lawyers?
* [19 August 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190819034652/https://twitter.com/NickRekieta/status/1163296220753866754): So, taking your hypothetical:  Let's say Vic loses every TCPA and all defendants are awarded fees and sanctions.  Great.  Now they have a piece of paper and zero dollars.  So, to get paid they have to pursue their clients.  The LAWYERS don't get a judgment against Vic...

They have to pay their lawyers, or their lawyers have to collect on any fee award.  Their lawyers don't just magically get paid because a judge said so...ask literally any lawyer.

Many of whom have motivation for their actions. Many others who are lacking facts.  You're a nobody with no knowledge screaming about something you don't understand.
* [19 August 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190819025801/https://twitter.com/NickRekieta/status/1163283386212999173): You keep saying everyone "knows what they are doing" but it seems like it's just stuff you made up in your mind.

I offered you a timeslot, you said you couldn't do it.  I said I MIGHT have you on another day unless "literally anything interesting" came up.  I got a guest who I much prefer to talk to and had a great show rather than a boring one.

It's not your sub count or anything so silly.  It's that you are completely irrelevant to anything I am talking about.  Your opinions about me are unimportant.

An idiot-Canadian-Paralegal's opinion of me is something so low on the scale I couldn't even find it.  Funny, you're talking about an experience you don't have as if you know anything about it.

I don't know Vic's bank account, I never put in my bank account, and GFM actually FREEZES THE WITHDRAWALS UNTIL THEY VERIFY THE BENEFICIARY BECAUSE THEY DON'T ALLOW FRAUD.  It's almost like this is their business...

Vic says he hired Ty on something like 2/19 or 2/20 (I don't know, check the Depo) this change would have been almost a month later.  Good job on dates.

SHOCKINGLY I WROTE A PUBLICLY VIEWABLE UPDATE ON THE GFM PAGE ABOUT IT, YOU ABJECT IDIOT. pic.twitter.com/6F9KadJMkv

GFM did it all when they asked (as they do when you set up a GFM for someone else) where the money would go.  You see, they actually don't EVER let you withdraw money when it's designated for a third party.

I'm sure you could make that argument, real attorney.

If you can change it (I have no idea) they actually note who has those privileges!  It's amazing!  It's almost like it's RIGHT OUT IN THE OPEN.  God, you are a good attorney.

That's not related to the case, but their lack of proof of anything is pretty embarrassing, publicly

That's probably why people are talking about the defendants proving it's true.  If Vic meets his burden to show it's defamatory, they will have to assert truthfulness or other defenses.

But the point is, you don't have to cite to KiwiFarms, there won't be a cite to KF to attack, if I had to guess   Because KF isn't the source of any information.

I'd be losing out on sitting there having my audience make fun of you.  It's likely funny, but I'd rather talk about something more interesting than some GamerGate holdover begging for relevance.

You can hold it to be whatever you want, but what it is is facially apparent if you aren't a moron.  2) You're reading onto others and ascribing motive.  Again, what's the negative proposition?

Put up or shut up.  "I HAVE OVER 250 BAR MEMBERSHIPS AND ILL BURY YOU IN ALL MY LICENSES"  Literal LoL.  Sure, kid.

Absolutely pathetic.  When you leave the mail room, return your boss's certificate to his office.

I believe I was confused in that preservation letters were sent prior to the 12th.  So, our argument is hypothetically possible, but I doubt we'll see it.
* [ 2 August 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190802211917/https://twitter.com/NickRekieta/status/1157399933076549632): I need to clarify, I have verified the letters that were sent:  I had a miscommunication about what was sent and I went to verify it from the dropbox:  The letters on the 12th are the letters, and each of them had tweets attached to them.  So that forecloses my mistaken assertion

Read the statute, there's no motion objecting to the sufficiency.  A Verified denial is not a motion to challenge.  Stop pretending to be a lawyer, you're getting your inadequacy all over everything.

* [ 2 August 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190802201724/https://twitter.com/NickRekieta/status/1157384902003896320): Good question.  You're saying they're insufficient under the statute.  Sufficiency would be argued at the motion to challenge within 60 days.  That was my point.
* [ 2 August 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190802201011/https://twitter.com/NickRekieta/status/1157383087388528640): I would too, assuming there wasn't a more voluminous and specific set of letters sent.  And if I were Ty, I would counter with a statement that the breadth of the letter that incorporates by reference the attached 370 tweets is included in the sufficiency under points 4 and 5. pic.twitter.com/JCaUFUDpkf

I don't get why the TDMA even exists.  It's impracticable, and certainly doesn't mitigate damages in the age of the internet.

I DON'T believe those have been provided to Shane Holmberg or are in the dropbox.  I do believe they were sent in March, prior to service of the suit.  I'd go check, but I'm lazy.

My opinion is that the validity of the letters is now moot, as the statutory window has passed.  If they wanted to challenge the TDMA letters, they should have done so within the window.

Law twitter is the ultimate authority on all things ;)  Since law twitter is right and Ty is incompetent, then they should have objected.  This is flawless logic.

Especially because law twitter was openly criticizing these things, I believe, within the 60 day window.  They should have objected, but they didn't.  Make fun of the letters all you want.  They're valid under the statute.

That doesn't mean they are defamatory under law, but it DOES mean that any that can be shown to be defamatory are covered under the statute.

But focusing on the TDMA letters is silly.  They had 60 days to object to the TDMA requests, they didn't do that.  They waived the objection and the TDMA requirement is fulfilled.  So, any statement that received...

Evidence already must be viewed favorable to Vic.  Having a lot of evidence with glaring credibility and admissibility problems will harm them.  I'm really interested to see what happens.

They're also different from her tweets   She's lying, and she knows it.

Funimation loses.  Since you, a reasonable person, believes he was, I think a jury will too.

Monica can't believe a first-hand story that's fiction.  The investigation is bogus, which is why funimation didn't simply produce it and assert it's truth.  Affidavit of the SM director says "we didn't SAY he was fired for the investigation"
* [27 July 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190727044209/https://twitter.com/NickRekieta/status/1154974666433421314): I believe they did.  Whether or not the factfinder will agree is a different story.

I believe malice can be shown at least sufficient to pass TCPA based on evidence I've seen, some of which is not filed, yet.  But this is not "free speech."  I defend the right for people to say the same stuff btw (remember? I'm the "blackface lawyer")

That's defamatory, that's not free speech.  The public figure question is not a question of whether it's defamatory (it is) it's a question of

Did you know that an actual agent for one of the defendants is a recognized predator banned from multiple conventions?  Not pretend-banned like Vic.  Actually banned by actual com owners.
* [27 July 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190727033645/https://twitter.com/NickRekieta/status/1154958752573005824): Oh, and you're on the side of people protecting literal people who are actually predators.  One of these guys has not cast women who refused to have sex with him.  One of the defendants agents is banned from conventions for being a sex pest.

Many of "you" have expressed disdain for them and mocked them.  They're smarter than you, they care more than you, and that's why your assessment of this is way off course.

* [27 July 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190727032945/https://twitter.com/NickRekieta/status/1154956445814837248): They would have buried him and the case.  But they didn't, because they can't, because it's a giant goddamn lie.  Yet, somehow, you all, a pack of lawyers, don't see it.  It's amazing.  At first I chalked it up to ignorance of the facts, now I have to chalk it up to pride.
* [27 July 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190727032945/https://twitter.com/NickRekieta/status/1154956445814837248): Funimation would have done well to say "it's all true, we investigated sexual misconduct and found it true and our tweet reflected that"  They didn't.  WHY?  It's a rock solid affirmative defense to do that and produce the business record.  They didn't.
* [27 July 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190727032945/https://twitter.com/NickRekieta/status/1154956445814837248): This is why the community doesn't believe you on law Twitter.  You're ignoring the insidious and personal nature of lies that have clearly caused damage.  You're ignoring Funimation's participation vis a vis a sham investigation that they won't produce and have shit explanations.

There are videos of Monica flirting with Vic after this.  It's not some tabloid piece.  These are people set to destroy someone with lies, not sell a silly newspaper. pic.twitter.com/6pz6lrVKee

These are his co-workers and their orbiters lending faux-credibility out of literal jealousy.  Monica, Ron, Marchi, they don't ACTUALLY BELIEVE that Vic's a predator.  Their stories are 7-12 years old and they did nothing but be friends.

I, personally, want to see people who lie to ruin someone's career and reputation punished.  We have a tort for that: defamation.

You know, the reason you bring a lawsuit.  You're misinterpreting me saying that filing the lawsuit has rallied people who are opposed to SocMed brigades ruining lives is the goal

That a bunch of people aching for someone to fight back against this social media brigading bullshit started to like and support him for it doesn't retroactively make it a SLAPP.

I'm guessing something even funnier is headed for MoRon.

Yeah, pretending that striking the evidence and affidavits is a waste is being willfully stupid.

Ty was standing while addressing the court.  The judge was JOVIALLY making a joke that he AS SENIOR PARTNER should be "standing up making the argument" rather than Jim.  You people have misread the situation because of your bias.

They should ALSO show that the other sides arguments for prima facie fail and they should ALSO ALSO be working their affirmative defenses that they need to prove by a preponderance of evidence.

I know you're super-duper committed to their side, but this is a big blunder in drafting.  Why defend it, aside from being a posturing weirdo?

In their motion paperwork, under the defamation argument, they ONLY ADDRESS the damages element of defamation.  That's sloppy drafting.

But in per se defamation, damages are presumed.  They don't even attempt to argue that he can't prove the falsity.

Some random, low-level staff writing a fan-fic about him getting banned over personal reasons doesn't mean he was actually banned.  That person isn't a decisionmaker and the actual makers disagree.

Going to tekko in 2004 and 2007 doesn't mean someone was banned in 2005 and 2006  This is ridiculously short of any factual analysis.  That testimony is undermined by the same moron affiant screeching that Vic was invited back DURING his ban

Especially since that filing had expired when they posted it, and was not my place of abode or business.  They can serve away!

All mail went to my principal place of business, which should have been the mailing address.  That's absurdly weird.

The fact being proved is not her mental state.  The fact being proved is did he see her in distress and ask if she was ok.  That's HER fact and she chose him as the witness to said fact.  Judge admits this statement NP.

Wouldn't it be a shame if she has conflicting interrogatory and deposition testimony AND the only other fact witness contradicts her story AND she spends the next 12 years being huggy, flirty, and affectionate.

But if two people are in the same room the other person doesn't get to just make up a story that can't be controverted because it's he said she said.  A party who is the only other fact witness is evidence

If I go to your house and then tell the world that while I was there I saw you looking at endless amounts of child pornography and call your employer to get you fired, you actually can fight it.

Just because the audience wants a bloodbath, doesn't mean in enjoy engaging in it.  Once the discussion got vitriolic, I no longer wanted to engage in a "debate" that would have zero good faith from either side.

As for "considered respect of many," great!  None of that addresses why that engagement would be a good proposition.  Also, watching her work, I have a feeling that would be a boring conversation.

Why leave it unanswered?

Literally arguing against an attorney doing due diligence.  Solid take, my dude.  Yet, the entire time, fail to even question a needless filing.

This would maybe be successful if opposing counsel and court weren't paying much attention.

They didn't actually make that filing, they filed a notice of intent to motion for permission to file that notice.
* [14 July 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190714223306/https://twitter.com/NickRekieta/status/1150533136918425601): Cute jab.  Still waiting for that legal basis.  You guys have all mentioned "ripeness" but ignoring the lack of requirement to even make that filing.

MTQ within 3 days is granted absent a hearing from the adversely affected party.  Maybe lemoine should have set it to get a win...

They didn't have any requirement to notice the court of an intent to file a motion for permission to notice me.  That's not ANY required filing, wastes the courts time and resources.  Not responding to that with an MTQ leaves a "notice" unopposed.
* [14 July 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190714211230/https://twitter.com/NickRekieta/status/1150512860851843073): The sun will expire long before anyone, much less I, could even attempt to correct your stupidity.

Bad optics, very possibly sanctionable.  Good argument for at least fees from MoRonica

This motion is filed prior to their own tcpa (frivolous)  Contains a theory to obtain public information (frivolous) and

They can't link the Depo motion to the only TCPA that exists, which is Funimation's.  They COULD POSSIBLY raise it again after filing.

I know there were material changes, but many of them are confidential and I'm not privy.  I thought letting you know that it was a kamehacon contract and that you can hypothetically assume Vic signed a materially congruent document would help

Possibly at the ruling on the TCPA, but possibly not, after that: summary judgment motions or just at trial.  We may not actually know for 6+ months.  We may know in 45 days.

For a man whose career was devastated in weeks, he was remarkably quiet.  This is why they badly want me to be his "mouthpiece" or agent.  I am not.

The courts aren't trigger happy on making someone into a public figure.  Their argument is that his tweets attempting to save his reputation are participatory in the controversy.  That's not an ironclad argument, no matter how many twitter lawyers say so.

Many people think it's a sure fire deal, but I, and a few others think there's a good argument to be made otherwise.  Part of the LPPF doctrine involves how much the figure inserted themselves

I disagree, so do Vic's lawyers, so do other lawyers.  Not much point in speculating further, now a TCPA is filed, we'll find out.

You're making up a controversy that doesn't exist.  Why in God's name would it be wrong to talk about something to increase participation?

The lunacy of the suggestion is mind blowing.

Malice which can be proven via circumstantial evidence including "the words or acts of the defendant before, during, or after publication."

If Patreon is an unrelenting machine of censorship for a situation as crazy as his, then leaving is justifiable.

As a somewhat professional debater, surely you can see the easy rebuttal to  @imwithdick : they never made the offer.  But if they DID make the offer, it's valid.

The moment they act together, it's no longer legal.  In this case, the retailer group chat that was leaked is evidence of collusion and unfair business practice.  It's not definitive, but it looks bad.
