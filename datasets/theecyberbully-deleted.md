Women who regret it deeply, women who are "shout your abortion" types, and women who don't abort and they should've for whatever reason.

It solves nothing. Shame has no correlation to increased abortions, though. Shame of sex can, no doubt, but shame about abortion usually makes teen mother homes a thing... which isn't ideal, either, obviously.

"Well, the other side is just as bad"? No. Shaming people for ending lives because they bent logic for base instinct is okay.
