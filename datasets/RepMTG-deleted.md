Biological males should NEVER be allowed to compete in women’s sports.  It’s time to take a stand.

As sanctions are being placed on Russian banks through SWIFT, Putin is moving to gold, but how long before Russia moves to the Yen?

We are in an awful position of weakness and have no negotiating strength because we import 7% of crude oil from Russia, our 3rd largest supplier.
