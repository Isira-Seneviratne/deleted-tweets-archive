May we never forget the morning of Dec. 7th, 1941, a date that will live in infamy. Let us also never forget those who died fighting to protect our freedoms. pic.twitter.com/vE41Qh9z0M

This is no way to represent the American people. pic.twitter.com/cFiG0c8v7A

Wishing death upon those with whom you disagree has no place in our political discourse. This is yet another example of the dangerous rhetoric fostered by Cancel Culture's mob mentality. http://www.foxnews.com/us/virginia-republicans-radical-left-democrats-let-them-die-pro-crt-rally

From attacks on critical infrastructure to misinformation campaigns, our adversaries seek to undermine the strength of the American people. The United States must actively invest in countering these cyber threats.
