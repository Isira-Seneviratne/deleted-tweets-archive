When I asked Biden's Homeland Security  @SecMayorkas  that simple question about our borders he said they were closed.  Now today when I asked the Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard the same question his reply is very different. pic.twitter.com/qd2rIhALZ3

Time to reclaim liberty and end this state of fear. https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2021/07/27/sen-ron-johnson-biden-mask-surrender/

Awarding huge contracts to move migrants to other places so people can't see what we saw in Donna, Texas. Without pictures, there will be not story. pic.twitter.com/M3ofAbqmqV
* [13 February 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210213222304/https://twitter.com/SenRonJohnson/status/1360715773652664327): The Democrats’ vindictive and divisive political impeachment is over. While there are still many questions that remain unanswered, I do know neither the Capitol beach nor this trial should have ever occurred. Hopefully, true healing can now begin.

Why would we now think it’s right to preemptively disenfranchise voters and overrule the states? It makes no sense.

They need to choose between being vindictive or staffing the administration to keep the nation safe. What will it be: revenge or security?
