* [29 May 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220529211322/https://twitter.com/DyingVenice/status/1531020803432542208): If Sven and Gina win, will Gina abolish the poor cat? üòø

* [18 May 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220518034813/https://twitter.com/DyingVenice/status/1526771559699988480) ([live](https://twitter.com/DyingVenice/status/1526764313838465025)): Literally everything they advocate for is anti-housing. They‚Äôll only be satisfied with permanent brand new single occupancy units in expensive areas, which cost ~$800k/unit. We all know that‚Äôs unrealistic and would take decades to build. Meanwhile 5 people are dying EVERY DAY.
* [17 May 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220518034813/https://twitter.com/DyingVenice/status/1526771559699988480) ([live](https://twitter.com/DyingVenice/status/1526589312866758656)): The difference is that you‚Äôre homeless by choice (or pretending to be). You are a terrible activist because you only advocate for people to stay homeless, and 99.99% of real homeless people have serious issues that need to be addressed and treated. You‚Äôre enabling them to death.
* [16 May 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220518034813/https://twitter.com/DyingVenice/status/1526771559699988480) ([live](https://twitter.com/DyingVenice/status/1526236334930554880)): I browsed them, but obviously haven‚Äôt read everything. Can you link to something that actually talks about your personal experience as a homeless person? Everything seems to be written from the perspective of a homeless activist, as opposed to an actual homeless person.
* [27 April 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220427161940/https://twitter.com/DyingVenice/status/1519350519579299841): Lol, they have a reporter whose entire job is to write hit pieces on LASD. She‚Äôs been putting out propaganda every day for months. The founder‚Äôs daughter has been open about her efforts to defund the department. https://twitter.com/hobo_city/status/1519155709115387904
* [26 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220326023639/https://twitter.com/DyingVenice/status/1507546997242224642): Rhetorical questions BTW, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre sick of me by now. Also, more Rico content please.
* [26 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220326023639/https://twitter.com/DyingVenice/status/1507546997242224642) ([live](https://twitter.com/DyingVenice/status/1507546770460450823)): I get the sense that many of them are nice well-intentioned young people who are simply misguided, but what they‚Äôre doing is so awful. Preventing severely sick people from getting into housing and treatment? Where is this insane ideology coming from?
* [17 March 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220317195852/https://twitter.com/DyingVenice/status/1504547839157813255): @daininspace @KateCagle @kdeleon Are you serious? @kdeleon barely gets a word in in this video. Just a bunch of uninformed extremists screaming nonsense ü§°
* [28 February 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220228164518/https://twitter.com/DyingVenice/status/1498338452449857540): https://twitter.com/cbsla/status/1498200668733063171
* [16 November 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211116194459/https://twitter.com/DyingVenice/status/1460694802102579201): Thanks for talking and not blocking üôè We need more of that, and I‚Äôm the first to admit that I can be too divisive at times. Twitter is not always the best for discussing complex issues
* [16 November 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211116194459/https://twitter.com/DyingVenice/status/1460694802102579201) ([live](https://twitter.com/DyingVenice/status/1460677701061070850)): Appreciate the more nuanced reply. We likely agree on more than we disagree. I don‚Äôt want a b+w approach either, but think Bales will be a much needed voice at the table to advocate for alternatives to the housing first approach, which hasn‚Äôt proven to be effective for most
* [16 November 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211116194459/https://twitter.com/DyingVenice/status/1460694802102579201) ([live](https://twitter.com/DyingVenice/status/1460669496570511362)): I have close family and friends who battle addiction, and if one of them ends up on Skid Row addicted to fentanyl I will beg anyone I can to have them thrown in jail. Addiction while living on the street is a death sentence and housing alone does nothing
* [16 November 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211116194459/https://twitter.com/DyingVenice/status/1460694802102579201) ([live](https://twitter.com/DyingVenice/status/1460667281143320579)): You have a strange understanding of the terms ‚Äúforced‚Äù and ‚Äúindoctrination‚Äù This is an optional program and one that has proven to be very successful. No one has to participate unless they choose to. You need to open your eyes to the addiction crisis we‚Äôre facing in this country.
* [16 November 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211116194459/https://twitter.com/DyingVenice/status/1460694802102579201) ([live](https://twitter.com/DyingVenice/status/1460664270534758401)): Well I certainly wouldn‚Äôt support forced labor or religious indoctrination either, but where on earth are you getting that from?
* [14 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210814021218/https://twitter.com/DyingVenice/status/1426366008361582594): If they were just drinking I‚Äôd agree with you, but openly selling alcohol on the crowded boardwalk? Do they allow that in Beverly Hills where you live?
* [13 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210814021218/https://twitter.com/DyingVenice/status/1426366008361582594) ([live](https://twitter.com/DyingVenice/status/1426027881763729413)): Illegal bar set up right on the boardwalk  #recallbonin  pic.twitter.com/vcB2Eub1b8
* [ 4 August 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210804023329/https://twitter.com/DyingVenice/status/1422747375915835394): @MikeBoninLA  bent over backwards to make sure LAPD wasn‚Äôt involved in the boardwalk encampment cleanups, only to have out of touch washed up celebs spread propaganda to their massive audiences, and mislead their followers into thinking the homeless were all evicted at gunpoint ü§£ https://twitter.com/sethgreen/status/1422648055040380929
* [20 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210720230052/https://twitter.com/DyingVenice/status/1417620508330262532): pic.twitter.com/nETuSgGYBS

* [20 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210720230052/https://twitter.com/DyingVenice/status/1417620508330262532) ([live](https://twitter.com/DyingVenice/status/1417314808446144513)): I know right? Sucks the most for the homeless minding their own business that have to deal with crime and the constant threat of violence, or worse if you‚Äôre female. It‚Äôs not safe for anyone and should never have been allowed to happen.
* [ 4 July 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210704192632/https://twitter.com/DyingVenice/status/1411768329715392514): Please tell us where they went jammy

This is the girl that caused it all by screaming at police and  trying to start a riot. She still has the video of it up on her Instagram  https://www.instagram.com/tv/CQpcoj1D-5N/  pic.twitter.com/QAAK7n9B5x

Five people are dying every day from living on the streets. What can we do to get people into housing today?
