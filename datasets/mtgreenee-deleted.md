Before Covid,  Employers didn’t demand employees vaccine records and firing employees based on their private medical info would have been discrimination & grounds for lawsuits.

The divisions created will be wedged further to build seathing hate, animosity, and blame on certain identities of Americans for the upcoming rising interest rates, out of control inflation, and tightening economy in ‘22.

I remember that episode.  Isn’t it interesting what we are now finding out about the Whitmer kidnapping case and the similarities of J6?

I do not fear solving problems, the swamp, or haters.  There is truly nothing to fear.  But the commies have many fears, and you can smell them.  Losing the power they clinch in their old wrinkled fists is their greatest fear.

I will not sit by watching my country complacently be controlled by tyrants.  There are well over 100 million Americans that feel the same way, they just don’t know what to do.

Our Founders understood more than anyone these important freedoms and put them first for all of us to use when the time came.  The time has come, and the People have yet to start.

Words that aren’t backed by action are nothing but infuriating puffs of air.  I’ve been successful all my life bc I live a life of action, and I entered politics bc most Republican politicians were void of it.

Ivermectin, HCQ, and other protocols work.   It is purely criminal to limit or deny use of these treatments against Covid.

I’m just saying torture and solitary confinement is WRONG for anyone and calling it out. How many books did you write condemning BLM rioters? Is there a manhunt for Antifa? 90%+ got off.  https://twitter.com/ryanjreilly/status/1475657088252747780  pic.twitter.com/41hOg40RId

He didn’t kill or rape anyone, hurt children, run over people in a Christmas parade, or illegally invade our border.  He rioted on J6 and deserves justice not torture.

I also told President Trump that the people are tired of investigations that do nothing and hold no one accountable.  They want a plan and they want action that saves our country and puts Americans first!  Enough of the talk.  He totally agrees with that too. 😊

I told President Trump that RINO’s like Mitch McConnell are to blame for all of our problems.  He agrees.  RINO’s are the worst!  I told him Republicans in the Senate are approving all of Biden’s picks in record speed and it’s nauseating.  They fought Trump’s picks nonstop.

For what I told President Trump, I’ll tell you all just a few things I said.  I told him I’m sick and tired of weak pathetic Republicans who won’t fight hard against the Democrats Communist agenda.  I told him I need strong courageous people to help me in Congress.  Cont’d

President Trump is very concerned about the border and the future of America.  He says tens of millions are going to be in our country who don’t belong because of the Democrats, and some of them will be very bad people who will do horrible things.  He said it must be stopped!

We discussed Georgia, my beautiful home state that I love so much.  Fulton county is one of the most corrupt counties in the country.   Everyone knows it.  Makes me sick.  Everyone knows widespread cheating occurred, even Democrat voters.  Biden voters have buyers remorse!

But unfortunately, the guy they kept in the basement, who supposedly got more black votes than Obama and more than any other presidential candidate, won’t do the job because he and Hunter have special friends and connections in China.

President Trump put tariffs on China against many people’s criticism and it was working!  Now Biden is handing Americans over to full dependency on the very enemy who sent us the deadly virus that’s now politicized to control us all.  There are reasons…

No one is.  Russia would not be advancing and remember it was Pres Trump who shut down Russia’s pipeline, but Biden shuts down America’s pipeline. Disgraceful!  North Korea was no longer a threat.

I told Pres Trump that it makes me sick how America is no longer respected in the world because of the weakness occupying the White House.  He told me:  He would have NEVER abandoned Americans in Afghanistan, allowed 13 service members needlessly die, or armed the Taliban.

President Trump also said that you wouldn’t be paying ridiculous high prices at the gas pump with him in charge.  Keystone pipeline would be under construction, we would be drilling for oil, and NOT begging OPEC to drill oil for us.  What a pathetic disgrace Joe Biden is.

For everyone that criticizes Pres Trump about when covid started with shoulda’s coulda’s and woulda’s, I think he and his administration did the best they could.  The virus was brand new and we’d never seen anything like it.  Biden deserves the criticism.  He has no excuses.

We should be holding those who made the virus accountable, not fighting one another.  And protecting our freedoms while promoting life saving treatments, and giving the vaccines to those who want it.  Not forced.

I have President Trump’s permission to tell you all that he is 100% AGAINST the mandates, but he still encourages everyone to get the vaccine and booster.  That is his position.  He also said if he was President he would never mandate the vaccines, and no one would be fired.

I just got off the phone with my favorite President of all time, Donald J. Trump.  We discussed many issues, people, races in ‘22 as well as vaccines and mandates.  We discussed  #COVID19 , how awful the virus from China has been, and how horribly it’s been politicized.  1/15

The entire effort should be focused on life saving treatments and returning life to normal.  Wide open. No masks. No mandates. No discrimination.

The danger ahead is that the BBB bill will likely be reshaped into some malleable form of the Green New Deal and Government healthcare.  All the Democrats want is to just start these programs so that they come up for funding votes again making them impossible to kill.

The truth is mining for rare earth minerals is extremely toxic and very bad for the environment and human health.  With China's dominance & America's inability to compete, why are people who claim they care about climate change & the Earth willing to go along with this plan?

If the average Democrat voter truly understood the lies of the Green New Deal and how it only benefits the top 1% while punishing everyone else and doing nothing to stop climate change, they would rapidly abandon voting for Democrats.

Carbon Tax Credits are the same as buying forgiveness for sins from a priest through indulgences.  Carbon Tax Credits don't reduce carbon emissions, it's a purchased pass to continue to produce carbon over the governments regulated amount.  Just another profit based scam.

More America last Democrat scams are plans to force businesses to net zero carbon emissions.  This will literally destroy small businesses and propel the large corporations to dominate.  The Paris Climate Treaty is another globalist trap that only rewards the elites.

America can NOT compete with less than 5% control of rare earth mineral mines and even less of battery production.  The US government forced plan to make Americans drive EV by 2035 is a failure from the start and Americans must stop seeing it through political lenses.

I have been warning about the Green New Deal and the dangers ahead for America by forcing American's to depend on Communist China to drive ever since I have been in Congress.  China dominates the battery market and controls over 85% of the world's rare earth minerals.

The government is forcing Americans to make the switch all in the name of the irrational claims of the Green New Deal religion.  Americans are NOT demanding mass production of EV & charging stations built at every corner.  Globalist elites are.

Now that Biden has signed the $1.2 Trillion Infrastructure bill into law, $7.5 billion tax payer dollars will be spent to build 500,000 EV charging stations across the US.  Not that supply and demand is screaming for  EV charging stations propelling this drastic action, no

The Democrat Pro-China policy moves could have been stopped by Republicans if they had even tried.  But Mitch McConnell led 19 R Senators to vote for the Infrastructure bill and 13 R House Reps sold out right along with them.  Hence passing phase 1 of the Green New Deal.

While economy & job killing decisions have been intentionally made to purposely inflate the price of gas for Americans at the pump, Democrats went into policy super drive to falsely deflate the price of buying and driving Electric Vehicles.  Pro-China bc the US can't compete.

None of these are the bumbling blunders of an old senile President.  Even the foolish move to sell off 50 billion barrels of US Strategic Oil Reserves to temporarily slightly lower gas prices are nothing but a fake attempt to appease critics and ease bad polling numbers.

You see in order to move a clueless population of people to do something they don't want to do, you have to slowly force it to happen without them realizing it.  Americans don't want to rely on China to drive, regardless of how they vote.

As Republicans cry high gas prices are a tax on everyone, they are missing the point.  And Democrat voters are lulled by fake promises & fantasies of the Green New Deal and how morally superior green energy makes them.

Too many people died and were never even given the chance with life saving covid treatments.  Too many of our elderly loved ones languished or died alone bc of our governments refusal to heavily pursue life saving treatments but instead pursue vaccines only, at all costs.

Many people I know, some who fall in the highest risk groups, obesity & older age, beat covid.  Most without even being hospitalized by receiving care from doctors who treat their patients with these life saving treatments.  Even Pres Trump did before he took the vaccine.

If they worked the data would show it and it doesn’t.  People and especially children are being forced to live miserable lives when they shouldn’t have to because the life saving treatments work.

I don’t judge people about the vaccines, and I think it’s a dangerous place we are in by doing so.  I have traveled and never stopped during covid and I’ve seen every scenario.

The problem for everyone is that depending on where you live, everyone has had a different experience since Covid started.  Also depending on the news you watch, people are biased by the biased information they have been fed.  Life saving treatments should be our unified goal.

We have to stop the division and discrimination between Vaccinated and Unvaccinated.  With vaccinated people still catching Covid and unvaccinated people being fired and treated like second class citizens, the entire world has gone mad.

But there are life saving treatments for covid and the variants now are hardly killing anyone.  The public should DEMAND the treatments.  To go along blindly with tyranny & deception is pure insanity.

I feel so badly for people who lost loved ones needlessly because life saving treatments were kept from them.  The government controlled flow of information forced the public to believe vaccines are the only way.  But it’s a lie and it’s wrong.

Being told covid can only be stopped by mass public vaccinations and forcing people to take covid vaccines that most of them don’t need, especially children, is morally and ethically wrong.  There are proven safe treatments that have saved lives and natural immunity is best.

All the Democrat policies that tell black people they are victims and can’t because of race are using black people for one thing.
